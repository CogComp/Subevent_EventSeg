Text	French suspect in Australia terror plot to stand trial by Pierre Rochiccioli . A Frenchman charged with abetting a high-profile assassination in Afghanistan and suspected of plotting a terror attack in Australia will stand trial in Paris early next year , legal officials said Tuesday . Willie Brigitte , a 38-year-old Muslim convert , was deported from Australia in October 2003 on immigration grounds and has been held in French custody since . Officials said Brigitte was to be brought before a Paris criminal court primarily on charges of helping supply false identity documents used by killers of Ahmad Shah Massood , an Afghan war chief fighting the Taliban who was murdered two days before the September 11 , 2001 attacks in the United States . Although five Islamic extremists were sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to seven years in May 2005 for their roles in that case , Brigitte was singled out for separate prosecution . His three - day trial is slated to begin on February 7 . France 's top anti-terrorist judge , Jean-Louis Bruguiere , signed the trial order for Brigitte on October 20 . The formal charge against Brigitte is for " associating with criminals in relation to a terrorist enterprise , " a charge which carries with it a maximum 10-year prison term . The document also indicted Sajid Mir , the suspected chief for overseas operations of the Lashkar-e-Toiba radical Islamic group active in Pakistan . Officials said other matters -- including Brigitte 's alleged plans to carry out an attack in Sydney -- may also be raised during the trial . Prosecutors believe that Mir , who remains at large but with a French warrant issued for his arrest , summoned Brigitte to Australia with a view to carrying out attacks in the country . The pair are suspected of plotting strikes on potential targets including a US electronic intelligence outpost in Pine Gap , central Australia , the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor in Sydney and military bases across the country . One of Brigitte 's contacts in Australia was allegedly Faheem Khalid Lodhi , a Pakistani-Australian architect sentenced this year to 20 years in jail for planning a terrorist act on Australian soil . Brigitte 's lawyer , Jean-Claude Durimel , said his client maintained his innocence . " My client contests all allegations of terrorist activity . He had gone to Australia to change his life , he never participated in attack plots , " he said . " There is no material evidence against my client " . . Brigitte , who is originally from the French Caribbean territory of Guadeloupe , converted to Islam in 1998 . That year he travelled to Yemen where he attended a Koranic school alleged by prosecutors to have links to Al-Qaeda , until he was expelled after a wave of arrests in Islamist circles . Upon his return to France , prosecutors believe Brigitte came into contact with sympathisers of the Algerian armed Islamist group the GSPC . During that period he is accused of running forest training camps in France for volunteer Islamist fighters preparing to leave for Afghanistan . Following the September 11 attacks , Brigitte is thought to have tried to reach Afghanistan , but got no further than Pakistan where prosecutors said he underwent military training in camps run by Lashkar-e-Toiba . Back in France , after a " sleeping period " , prosecutors believe he left for Australia after receiving a green light from Mir .
