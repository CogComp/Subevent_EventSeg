ISTANBUL, Turkey

The explosion that killed five people and wounded 13 on Saturday in
the Turkish resort town of Kusadasi was set off by a timer or remote
control, not a suicide bomber, a regional government official said
Sunday.

<P>
The governor of Aydin Province, Mustafa Malay, said the blast was
caused by a small device that was apparently placed under a window
seat in the second to last row of a minibus.

Investigators are still awaiting the forensic identification of the
type of explosives, and are examining possible links between the
bombing on Saturday and an attack that wounded 20 people in Cesme,
another seaside town, on July 10.

<P>
"No one has yet claimed responsibility of the attack in Kusadasi, but
given the similarities with the attack in Cesme last week, experts are
examining a possible link between them," Malay said.

An armed Kurdish group, the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks Organization (TAK)
that is thought to be a splinter group of the separatist Kurdish
Worker's Party (PKK) claimed responsibility for the attack in Cesme.
The military wing of the PKK, which has been fighting for autonomy in
the Turkish southeast for more than 20 years, on the other hand,
denied responsibility for the attack and said it had no links with any
other Kurdish groups, including TAK, in a written statement to a
Kurdish news agency on Sunday.

Four women were killed in the attacks: Eda Okyay, 24, and Deniz Tutum,
21, from Turkey, as well as two foreign tourists, Helen Bennett, 21,
of Britain, and Tara Whelan, 17, of Ireland; and a Turkish man, Ufuk
Yucedeniz, 23.
