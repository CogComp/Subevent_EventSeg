BAGHDAD, Iraq
</P>
<P>
A lieutenant of Jordanian terrorist leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi said
to have supervised the construction of 32 car bombs was taken into
custody 10 days ago, Iraqi officials announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sami Muhammad Ali Said Jaaf admitted to involvement in a substantial
share of the car bombs that have exploded in Iraq since August 2003,
according to Thaer Qatib, a spokesman for interim Prime Minister Ayad
Allawi.
</P>
<P>
Qatib said Jaaf, who went by the nom de guerre Abu Umar Kurdi, was
captured in a raid in Baghdad Jan. 15. There was no way of verifying
Jaaf's admissions or the government's claim that he was involved in
some 75 percent of the car bombings in Baghdad since August, 2003.
</P>
<P>
In a flurry of pre-election good news, the government also announced
the capture of al-Zarqawi's ``chief of propaganda,'' 10 insurgent
leaders in Ramadi, the capital of troubled Anbar Province west of
Baghdad and a resistance leader in the violent northern city of Mosul,
Iraq's third largest city.
</P>
<P>
``Every arrest of a terrorist in Iraq is making our country safer,
bringing us one step closer to a peaceful and prosperous Iraq,'' Thaer
said.
</P>
<P>
The accused bomb maker Jaaf allegedly confessed to organizing many of
the most notorious attacks in Iraq, including the September, 2003
truck bombing of the United Nations headquarters, the car bomb that
killed Ayatollah Mohammed Bakir Hakim outside a shrine in Najaf, the
attack that killed the serving president of the Governing Council as
his convoy approached the Green Zone in May 2004 and the September
2004 double car bombing at a water treatment plant in south Baghdad
that killed dozens of children.
</P>
<P>
All told, the attacks killed hundreds, most of them civilians cut down
by the devastating blast wave and shrapnel typically thrown hundreds
of yards.
</P>
<P>
Other bomb makers clearly remain at large. A vehicle packed with
explosives detonated Monday morning outside the headquarters of the
political party led by Allawi, the Iraqi National Accord.
</P>
<P>
The building, located near the capital's center, was struck by a car
bomb earlier this month. Allawi's spokesman also trumpeted arrests of
Zarqawi's ``chief of propaganda,'' Hasam Hamad Abdullah Muhsin al-
Dulaymi, known as ``Dr. Hassan,'' in a raid before Jaaf was taken.
</P>
<P>
Naqib said Hassan took over distributing public statements for
Zarqawi's network after his previous chief propagandist, Hassan
Ibrahim, was killed by coalition forces in a Baghdad raid Dec. 13.
</P>
<P>
``Dr. Hassan has told us that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi designated Abu Umar
al-Kurdi as the lieutenant responsible for attacking election sites
located in Baghdad,'' Naqib said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is scheduled to hold its first nationwide election in decades on
Sunday. Zarqawi and other insurgents have threatened to disrupt the
balloting and to kill voters after they return from the polls.
</P>
<P>
Al-Zarqawi also recently issued a statement urging followers to buckle
down for the long haul in Iraq, warning that the battle against U.S.
and Iraqi forces in the country could drag on for years.
</P>
<P>
Allawi's spokesman seized on that statement as evidence that the
terrorist leader is losing ground. ``The recent call by Zarqawi for
patience tells us that he is losing his fight against the Iraqi
people,'' Naqib said. ``He is losing his key cell leaders, planners
and bomb builders every day to Iraqi and coalition security forces.''
