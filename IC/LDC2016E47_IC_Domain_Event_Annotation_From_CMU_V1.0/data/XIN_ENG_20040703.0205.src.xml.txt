</HEADLINE>

CAIRO, July 3 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
A militant group claimed Saturday that it had beheaded a US Marine of
Lebanese descent taken hostage earlier in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We inform you that (Wassef Ali) Hassoun, the Marine of Lebanese
descent, has been decapitated," said the group, Jaish Ansar al-Sunna,
in a statement posted on an Islamic Website.
</P>
<P>
"You will see the video soon," the message said.
</P>
<P>
The authenticity of the Arabic-language statement, which was addressed
to US President George W. Bush and demanded the withdrawal of US
troops from Iraq, has yet to be verified.
</P>
<P>
The US military has confirmed that Hassoun had been missing from his
unit, which was operating west of Fallujah, since June 21.
</P>
<P>
Pan-Arab satellite TV al-Jazeera reported on June 27 that Iraqi
militants had allegedly kidnapped Hassoun and threatened to behead him
unless Iraqi prisoners are released.
</P>
<P>
The TV station aired a video tape of militants holding a blindfolded
24-year-old Hassoun with a sword poised over his head.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon had no immediate comment on the decapitation claim.
</P>
<P>
Hassoun's father and brother in Lebanon said they had heard the news
but the death had not been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Ansar al-Sunna also said in its statement that they will issue a new
tape showing a     new "infidel" hostage, but it did not give the
nationality of the captive.
</P>
<P>
A spate of kidnappings of foreigners has hit Iraq and a militant group
led by Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, accused by the US of links to
Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda, has claimed responsibility for beheading
an American and a South Korean.
</P>
<P>
On June 22, Zarqawi's group beheaded South Korean hostage Kim Sun-il
after Seoul refused to withdraw its forces from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In May, the group decapitated US hostage Nicholas Berg. One group of
militants killed Italian civilian Fabrizio Quattrocchi in April but
later freed three of his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Just hours after Washington's handover of power to the new Iraqi
government last Monday, al Jazeera broadcast a video tape showing what
militants said was the killing of US Private Keith Matthew Maupin, 20.
</P>
<P>
On one of the deadliest days since the new Iraqi government took over,
a US soldier, six Iraqi national guardsmen and a policeman were killed
by insurgents on Saturday, security and medical sources said.
</P>
<P>
"Five dead bodies were brought in here, including one lieutenant and
four soldiers, as well as five wounded people, three of whom were
seriously hurt," said a doctor at a hospital in Mahmudiyah, 30 km
south of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
One of the five wounded died later at the capital's Yarmuk Hospital,
another medical source said.
</P>
<P>
A national guard commander said the soldiers were attacked while
guarding a pipeline near the small town of Latifiyah, which has been a
target of repeated rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
A US marine died after an attack west of Baghdad, while a British
soldier sustained minor injuries in a bomb attack on a military convoy
in southern Basra.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi policeman was also killed in an attack on a traffic control
point in the northern city of Mosul on Friday, US-led forces said.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to thwart attacks, the interim government has said it
would announce emergency measures "very soon," the Iraqi deputy prime
minister for national security, Barham Saleh, said in a TV interview
broadcast late Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This law will give the government the capability of imposing
emergency laws in specific areas and for set periods to deal with
terrorist threats," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 people died in Iraq in a spate of bloody attacks last
month in the run-up to the handover of power on June 28.
</P>
<P>
The militants had warned they would continue attacking Iraqi officials
and US-led foreign forces, despite the power handover, until "God's
law" prevailed in Iraq.
