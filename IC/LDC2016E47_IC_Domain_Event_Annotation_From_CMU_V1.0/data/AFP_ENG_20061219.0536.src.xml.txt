French suspect in Australia terror plot to stand trial by Pierre
Rochiccioli
</HEADLINE>

A Frenchman charged with abetting a  high-profile assassination in
Afghanistan and suspected of plotting  a terror attack in Australia
will stand trial in Paris early next  year, legal officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Willie Brigitte, a 38-year-old Muslim convert, was deported from
Australia in October 2003 on immigration grounds and has been held  in
French custody since.
</P>
<P>
Officials said Brigitte was to be brought before a Paris  criminal
court primarily on charges of helping supply false identity  documents
used by killers of Ahmad Shah Massood, an Afghan war chief  fighting
the Taliban who was murdered two days before the September  11, 2001
attacks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Although five Islamic extremists were sentenced to prison terms
ranging from two to seven years in May 2005 for their roles in that
case, Brigitte was singled out for separate prosecution. His  three-
day trial is slated to begin on February 7.
</P>
<P>
France's top anti-terrorist judge, Jean-Louis Bruguiere, signed  the
trial order for Brigitte on October 20.
</P>
<P>
The formal charge against Brigitte is for "associating with  criminals
in relation to a terrorist enterprise," a charge which  carries with
it a maximum 10-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
The document also indicted Sajid Mir, the suspected chief for
overseas operations of the Lashkar-e-Toiba radical Islamic group
active in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Officials said other matters -- including Brigitte's alleged  plans to
carry out an attack in Sydney -- may also be raised during  the trial.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors believe that Mir, who remains at large but with a  French
warrant issued for his arrest, summoned Brigitte to Australia  with a
view to carrying out attacks in the country.
</P>
<P>
The pair are suspected of plotting strikes on potential targets
including a US electronic intelligence outpost in Pine Gap, central
Australia, the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor in Sydney and military
bases across the country.
</P>
<P>
One of Brigitte's contacts in Australia was allegedly Faheem  Khalid
Lodhi, a Pakistani-Australian architect sentenced this year  to 20
years in jail for planning a terrorist act on Australian  soil.
</P>
<P>
Brigitte's lawyer, Jean-Claude Durimel, said his client  maintained
his innocence.
</P>
<P>
"My client contests all allegations of terrorist activity. He  had
gone to Australia to change his life, he never participated in  attack
plots," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no material evidence against my client."
</P>
<P>
Brigitte, who is originally from the French Caribbean territory  of
Guadeloupe, converted to Islam in 1998.
</P>
<P>
That year he travelled to Yemen where he attended a Koranic  school
alleged by prosecutors to have links to Al-Qaeda, until he  was
expelled after a wave of arrests in Islamist circles.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return to France, prosecutors believe Brigitte came  into
contact with sympathisers of the Algerian armed Islamist group  the
GSPC.
</P>
<P>
During that period he is accused of running forest training  camps in
France for volunteer Islamist fighters preparing to leave  for
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Following the September 11 attacks, Brigitte is thought to have  tried
to reach Afghanistan, but got no further than Pakistan where
prosecutors said he underwent military training in camps run by
Lashkar-e-Toiba.
</P>
<P>
Back in France, after a "sleeping period", prosecutors believe  he
left for Australia after receiving a green light from Mir.
