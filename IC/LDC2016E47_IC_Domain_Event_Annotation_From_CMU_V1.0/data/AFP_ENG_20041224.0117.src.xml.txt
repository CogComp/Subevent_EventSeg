Ansar al-Sunna accuses US of misinformation over Mosul blast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Al-Qaeda linked group which said it carried out the deadly attack
against US soldiers in the Iraqi city of Mosul accused the United
States of feeding misinformation about the bombing, according to a
statement posted on its website Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, whose authenticity could not be confirmed, was signed
by the "information section" of the Army of Ansar al-Sunna, which has
claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack in which 14 US soldiers
were among 22 people killed.
</P>
<P>
Another 72 people were injured in the blast.
</P>
<P>
The operation, "one of the heaviest blows to the crusaders and which
they will never forget", was the work of a "martyrdom-seeker" from the
Army of Ansar al-Sunna, said the latest statement.
</P>
<P>
It was released as US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made a
surprise Christmas Eve visit to troops in Mosul.
</P>
<P>
"We are monitoring the crusaders as they hold conferences and analyze
this blow, trying -- as usual -- to mislead people by variously saying
that it was a mortar and rocket attack or that it was a suicide
operation with local (improvised) explosives," said the statement,
dated December 23.
</P>
<P>
"Are they that stupid that they still don't know the nature of the
blow they received, or was the blow so painful that they don't dare
say the truth?" it scoffed.
</P>
<P>
"The US officials' talk is groundless. God willing, we will very soon
release a statement giving the full details of the blessed Mosul
conquest and the losses suffered by the crusaders," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Ansar al-Sunna had claimed responsibility for what it described as a
suicide attack a few hours after an explosion ripped through a canteen
at a US army base in the northern Iraqi city on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Richard Myers,
said on Wednesday that it appeared to be a suicide bombing carried out
by an attacker wearing an "improvised explosive device".
</P>
<P>
US President George W. Bush had suggested the explosion, the deadliest
single attack on American forces in Iraq, was caused by a rocket
attack.
</P>
<P>
The base commander, Brigadier General Carter Ham, said on Thursday
that the suicide bomber who carried out the attack was likely wearing
an Iraqi army uniform.
</P>
<P>
Ansar al-Sunna has split from another radical group, called Ansar al-
Islam, both of which are believed to have links with suspected Al-
Qaeda operative Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Iraq's most-wanted man.
