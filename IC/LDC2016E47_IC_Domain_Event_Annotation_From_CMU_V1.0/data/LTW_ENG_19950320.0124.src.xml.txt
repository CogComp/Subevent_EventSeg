Turkey Attacks Kurdish Rebels in Northern Iraq (Ankara)

ANKARA, Turkey
</P>
<P>
Turkey launched a large-scale military assault against Kurdish
separatist bases in northern Iraq Monday, dispatching a 35,000-man
force backed by warplanes, armored vehicles and artillery along a
front stretching 135 miles through rugged border mountains.
</P>
<P>
The attack, on the eve of the Newroz spring festival celebrated by
many Kurds, marked Turkey's largest military campaign on foreign soil,
including the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, according to
government spokesman Yildirim Aktuna. But Turkey has launched previous
raids into Iraq, notably in 1992, when 20,000 troops were sent in to
flush rebels from their mountain bases and 2,500 rebels were killed,
according to the government.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller described Monday's offensive as part of a
growing battle to vanquish the separatist insurgency in southeastern
Turkey being waged by guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers' Party. An
estimated 15,000 people have been killed in the 10-year-old conflict,
which has included terrorist tactics by the separatists and widely
criticized reprisals by the Turkish military.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said the offensive will continue until the objective of
clearing the Iraqi border area of Kurdish forces is achieved. She
forcefully reiterated what she described as her government's
determination to ``stamp out terrorism against the state.''
</P>
<P>
``The operation will be of limited duration and the forces involved
will be withdrawn immediately following the elimination of the
targets,'' a government statement said.
</P>
<P>
The massive operation, involving mostly elite commando units, was the
latest illustration of the Ciller government's pursuit of a military
solution to the Kurdish insurgency, despite the heavy costs to
Turkey's already battered economy -- an estimated $7 billion last year
-- and mounting accusations of human rights abuses associated with the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Western nations, especially European ones, have increasingly urged
Turkey to improve its human rights record. At the same time, Ankara
has received support from the United States and Western European
governments for its fight against Kurdish terrorism. But both foreign
and domestic groups have pressed the government to consider a
political solution to the larger issue of political and human rights
for the 12 million Kurds among Turkey's 60 million inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
There are about 20 million Kurds in the mountainous region where the
borders of Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey converge. The Kurds are the
world's largest ethnic group without an independent homeland, despite
years of struggle. About 3.5 million live in Iraq, primarily in the
north.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration raised no objections to the military
campaign, citing government pledges that the operation will be limited
and is directed against ``terrorist operations.'' White House Press
Secretary Michael McCurry said Ciller offered President Clinton a
briefing on the operation and assurances of the limited goals and
duration during a 10-minute telephone conversation that the two
leaders had Monday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's long-running war against the Kurdistan Workers' Party has
presented a dilemma for the Clinton administration. The United States
values Turkey as a NATO ally. In addition, the administration needs
Ankara's cooperation to continue Provide Comfort, the military
operation begun after the 1991 Persian Gulf War to protect the Kurds
of northern Iraq from the government of Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
That effort covers some of the same territory attacked Monday by
Turkish forces with tacit U.S. assent.
</P>
<P>
Ciller assured Clinton in the telephone conversation that care is
being taken to avoid civilian casualties and that the operation is
being conducted in keeping with international law giving the right to
``hot pursuit'' of terrorists, Turkish sources said.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate reaction from Baghdad, the Iraqi capital.
</P>
<P>
The targeted Kurdish camps are located near the border in the Sinad-
Haftanin, Methina and Khakurk regions of northern Iraq, Turkish
officials said, adding that about 2,400 to 2,800 rebels were believed
sheltered there. Fourteen Turkish warplanes bombed Kurdish targets in
the area of Bote, while elite commando, mechanized and armored forces
penetrated 25 miles into northern Iraq, Turkish military spokesman
Doqu Silahcioglu said.
</P>
<P>
The push into Iraq comes amid increased fighting between Iraqi Kurdish
groups that Ankara has said provides a fertile environment for the
Kurdistan Workers' Party. The Kurdistan Democratic Party of Massoud
Barzani and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan led by Jalal Talabani,
the two Iraqi groups that have set up a de facto government in
northern Iraq under cover of Provide Comfort, have been fighting
intermittently since April.
