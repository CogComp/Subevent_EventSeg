<P>
A council member from a town north of Baghdad was shot dead Saturday
and a car bomb near the Shiite shrine city of Najaf killed three
Iraqis and wounded two others.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Committee of Muslim Scholars, a powerful grouping of
Sunni clerics, accused US forces of killing one of its members.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday morning, a group of gunmen shot dead Jalil Ibrahim, a
local council member, and his friend Ali Muhammad, in Taji, about 20
kilometres (15 miles) north of Baghdad, a police official said on
condition of anonymity. The town is home to US and Iraqi military
bases, and a centre of rebel activity.
</P>
<P>
Three Iraqis were killed and two wounded in a car bombing between the
Shiite holy cities of Najaf and Karbala, said hospital officials.
</P>
<P>
"Three Iraqis were killed and two wounded in the blast," said Yusif
Zahi, a doctor at a clinic in Khan al-Nus, north of Najaf.
</P>
<P>
He said the attack took place at about 3:00 pm (1200 GMT) in the path
of a US military convoy, which escaped unscathed.
</P>
<P>
The committee of scholars, which claims to represent 3,000 mosques in
Iraq, accused US soldiers of raiding the home Friday of Sheikh Mowafaq
Muzaffar al-Duri, the prayer leader at Baghdad's Abu Bakr Seddiq
mosque, and "savagely executing" him.
</P>
<P>
One cleric, Sheikh Yehyia al-Tai, said the Americans had raided the
group's offices in Iskandariyah, south of Baghdad, Saturday. And the
statement said the Americans raided their offices based on "false
information supplied by people who sold their soul to the devil."
</P>
<P>
The US military had no information on any of the incidents.
</P>
<P>
The committee recently said 20 of its clerics had been assassinated
since the fall of Saddam, while more than 80 had been arrested by the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
It has called on the country's Sunni minority, ousted from power with
the fall of Saddam Hussein, to boycott next month's elections for an
Iraqi national parliament.
</P>
<P>
Police also said a US patrol opened fire and killed a suspect who
tried to flee them in his car in western Baghdad, near the old
Muthanna airport.
</P>
<P>
The US military said it had no information on the incident.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the governor of Diyala province, Abdullah Hassan al-Jaburi,
narrowly escaped a bomb attack on his convoy in Baquba that wounded
two policemen and two of his bodyguards, police said.
</P>
<P>
By his own account, Jaburi has survived at least two assassination
attempts in the past year.
</P>
<P>
In a coup for the US military, the marines announced Saturday two
insurgents with links to Iraq's most wanted man, Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi,
have been arrested in the turbulent city of Ramadi.
</P>
<P>
Saleh Arugayan Kahlil, also called Abu Ubaydah, and Bassim Mohammad
Hazem, also known as Abu Khattab, were captured respectively on
December 8 and 12 in Ramadi, the marines said.
</P>
<P>
The pair were leaders of a cell the marines called the "Harun
terrorist network".
</P>
<P>
Marines accused the group of murdering 11 Iraqi national guardsmen,
blowing up booby-trap devices and car bombs that killed or wounded
dozens of Iraqis and smuggling foreign fighters into the country to
fight the US-backed Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
The marines also announced they had arrested 29 people since Friday in
Ramadi in an offensive dubbed Operation Wonderland, aimed at rounding
up insurgents.
