JERUSALEM, July 5 (Xinhua)

<P>
An urgent meeting of Israeli  security cabinet convened by Prime
Minister Ehud Olmert decided on Wednesday to expand the ongoing
military operation in the Gaza  Strip in reaction to stepped-up
Palestinian rocket attack.
</P>
<P>
Local media said that the cabinet also decided to create a " security
buffer zone" in the northern Gaza Strip in a bid to   prevent attacks
on innocent civilians.

<P>
A Qassam rocket landed at the center of the southern Israeli  coastal
city of Ashkelon for the first time on Tuesday evening,  causing
damages to a high school building but no injury.
</P>
<P>
It was the furthest north in Israel that a Qassam fired from  Gaza has
reached, signaling that Palestinian militants have  improved the range
of the primitive weapons.
</P>
<P>
Hamas' armed wing, the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, claimed
responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
In response to the strike, Defense Minister Amir Peretz on  Tuesday
ordered the Israel Defense Forces to step up the pace and  force of
its operation in the Gaza Strip to secure the return of  an abducted
Israeli soldier.

<P>
Israeli security forces foiled on Wednesday "a large-scale  terror
attack" set to be launched in the center of the country  after a
would-be attacker was arrested, local Israeli newspaper  Yedioth
Ahronoth said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Israeli defense establishment  currently
holds 19 specific alerts regarding plans to carry out  attacks, most
of them are related to the Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Israeli troops killed a wanted Fatah militant in  the
West Bank town of Jericho, who was allegedly involved in  potential
attacks and was responsible for an attack in 2000 in  which an Israeli
taxi driver was killed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Israel Defense Forces nabbed ten wanted  Palestinian
militants in the West Bank, who are believed to be  operatives from
Hamas and Fatah.
