ISTANBUL, Turkey
</P>
<P>
A Kurdish militant group claimed responsibility for a bomb blast near
a bus stop in Istanbul Friday that killed one person and injured 13
others, saying the attack was in response to recent violence in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blast follows three days of some of the worst street violence
in overwhelmingly Kurdish southeastern Turkey in a decade. Seven
people were killed during the rioting, including a 3-year-old boy
killed Friday. The fighting pitted Kurds against Turkish police and
paramilitary police.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one Kurdish rebels have also been killed in fighting in the
southeast during the past few days.
</P>

"From now on, every attack against our people will be met immediately
by even more violent acts," the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons said in an
e-mail to journalists. "We will start to harm not just property but
lives too. With our actions we will turn Turkey into hell. The bomb
attack in Kocamustafapasa, carried out by our action team, was just a
warning."
</P>
<P>
The bomb went off in a garbage can in the Kocamustafapasa district of
Istanbul. A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the bomb was believed to have contained plastic explosives. Turkish
rules bar civil servants from speaking to journalists on the record
without prior authorization.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons is a hardline group believed to be
linked to the main Kurdish guerrilla group, the Kurdistan Workers
Party, or PKK.
</P>
<P>
The shadowy group has claimed responsibility for a number of bomb
attacks in Turkey, including a blast in the Aegean resort town of
Cesme last summer that wounded 21 people.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul Gov. Muammer Guler said the man killed in the Istanbul blast
was a street vendor who sold sesame-coated pretzels. A child was among
the injured, CNN-Turk television reported.
</P>
<P>
Video footage broadcast on CNN-Turk showed debris scattered across a
residential street in Istanbul, covering the sidewalk and parked cars.
</P>
<P>
Ambulances with flashing lights moved down the street while police
carrying submachine guns tried to keep crowds of people from the site.
</P>
<P>
A bomb disposal expert wearing protective gear checked nearby garbage
canisters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, bomb disposal teams destroyed a remote-controlled
bomb containing C-4 plastic explosives in the Aegean port city of
Izmir, NTV television reported.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was hidden inside a flower pot left by the side of a road
frequently used by police, NTV said. It was discovered by a woman who
took the pot home.
</P>
<P>
Kurdish rebels have carried out attacks using C-4 explosives in the
past.
