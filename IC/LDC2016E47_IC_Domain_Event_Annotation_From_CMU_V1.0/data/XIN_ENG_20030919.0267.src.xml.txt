BAGHDAD, Sept. 19 (Xinhua) -- Former Iraqi Defense Minister Sultan
Hashem Ahmad surrendered to the US-led coalition forces on Friday as
the anti-American attacks demonstrated a streak of coordination.
</P>
<P>
"Sultan Hashem Ahmad al-Jabburi al-Tai, No. 27 on the coalition's list
of most wanted government officials, is now under custody of coalition
forces," said a statement issued by the US Central Command on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The former Iraqi minister of defense turned himself in to the 101st
Airborne Division on Sept. 19," it added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Daoud Bagistani, a Kurd human rights activist and mediator
between the US military and Ahmed's family, told reporters that Ahmed
gave himself up early Friday in his house in Mosul, 450 km north of
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Mosul is where former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's two elder sons,
Uday and Qusay, were killed in their hide-out by US troops in July.
</P>
<P>
So far, 40 of the 55 most wanted have either surrendered or been
arrested or killed.
</P>
<P>
According to Bagistani, the US military has kept its promise to treat
the former official "with dignity and respect" and Ahmed will only be
held in custody long enough to be questioned.
</P>
<P>
The mediator said Ahmed's name, the eight of hearts in a deck of cards
issued by Washington to represent the 55 figures, will be removed from
the wanted list.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed, who signed the cease-fire treaty with the US army at the end
the first Gulf War, was said to have been disfavored by his boss
Saddam and was under house arrest before the US-led war on Iraq in
March.
</P>
<P>
In another development, three soldiers of the 4th Infantry Division
were killed and two wounded in a fierce overnight firefight with
unidentified attackers in Saddam's hometown of Tikrit, 160 km north of
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The attacks, bursting out when the US troops were conducting an
investigating operation, were the most intense and coordinated since
US forces arrived in the area in April, according to a spokeswoman of
the Division.
</P>
<P>
The fighting was the latest of a series of assaults across the
central-northern area of Iraq, following an audio tape purportedly of
Saddam aired by Dubai-based Arabiya TV channel on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A voice claimed to be that of Saddam urged the US-led coalition forces
to withdraw unconditionally and called on the Iraqis to wage holy war
against the occupation.
</P>
<P>
"Collapse is starting to eat the banks and rows of the enemy as fire
does dry stalks, and the day when they cannot even save their military
equipments is near," said the voice.
</P>
<P>
Two US military vehicles were burned when they hit a roadside bomb
near Khadldiya, a restive small town 80 km west of Baghdad, late
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the troops were then fired on by rocket-propelled
grenades and small arms, and Arabiya channel reported that eight US
soldiers were killed in the incident.
</P>
<P>
However, US spokesman Lt. Col. George Krivo on Friday dismissed the
reported toll as a "flawed, inaccurate," but gave no official account.
</P>
<P>
In the northern city of Mosul, the US forces encountered a spate of
attacks from Wednesday night to early Thursday, during which several
sites of US presence were fired with grenades, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Baghdad, several explosions were heard on
Friday, but no heavy casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
A small bomb placed in a roadside trash can near the People's Stadium
in eastern part of the city went off at around 9:00 pm (0500 GMT), two
hours before the night curfew.
</P>
<P>
CNN reported that a taxi passing by was damaged and a lady and three
children in the car were slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
The news channel said another blast occurred minutes later in al-
Mansur neighborhood in western Baghdad and was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, another huge explosion was heard in Western
Baghdad. A Xinhua correspondent said a cloud of smoke dozens meters
high could be seen and the bombing was probably somewhere by the
highway leading to the restive town of Fallujah.
</P>
<P>
Explosions have become a usual case in Iraqis' daily life. Some of the
blasts were bombing attacks on the US-led coalition forces while the
others were controlled detonation of unexploded devices by US troops.
