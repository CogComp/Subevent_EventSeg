<P>
The radical Muslim Islamic Jihad and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades
claimed responsibility for killing an Israeli soldier in the Gaza
Strip Sunday, in a joint statement sent to AFP in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
"Around 7:30 this morning our heroes of the Jerusalem Brigades
(Jihad's armed wing) and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades attacked with
bombs and automatic weapons a convoy of Zionist soldiers south of the
Kissoufim roadblock in the Gaza Strip, killing one Zionist soldier and
wounding four more," it said.
</P>
<P>
The attackers were unharmed, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The two groups also said they attacked a convoy of soldiers and
settlers on the road between the Jewish settlement of Netzarim and the
Karni crossing point between the Gaza Strip and Israel, wounding a
number of people.
</P>
<P>
Both incidents were confirmed by Israeli sources, which said that one
soldier was killed and three wounded in the first attack, but there
were no casualties in the second.
</P>
<P>
"The Jerusalem Brigades and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades state that
these heroic operations are responses of the Palestinian people to the
crimes committed by the Zionists in the camps of Balata and Jenin and
throughout Palestine," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The Al-Aqsa Brigades claimed responsibility for a suicide bomb in
Jerusalem Saturday which killed nine Israelis and wounded more than
50. A further 10 were killed in the West Bank Sunday by a Palestinian
sniper in an attack which has yet to be claimed.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers were killed in
fierce fighting after Israeli incursions last week in the Balata and
Jenin refugee camps in the West Bank, prompting threats of vengeance
by the Al-Aqsa Brigades.
