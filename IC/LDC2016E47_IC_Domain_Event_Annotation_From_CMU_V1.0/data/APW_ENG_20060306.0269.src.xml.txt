DHAKA, Bangladesh

<P>
An Islamic militant leader blamed for recent deadly bombings tried to
blow himself up to avoid capture before being arrested Monday by
security forces in northern Bangladesh, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Siddiqul Islam was captured at his hideout in northern Mymensingh
district, said Mashuk Hasan, an official of Bangladesh's Rapid Action
Battalion, an elite anti-crime force that led the operation.
</P>
<P>
Islam is one of the top leaders of Jumatul Mujahedeen Bangladesh, a
militan group blamed for a wave of bombings across Bangladesh in
recent months that killed at least 26 people. The group seeks to
introduce harsh Islamic rule in Bangladesh, which is governed by
secular laws.
</P>
<P>
About 50 security agents surrounded the tin-roof house in Muktagachha,
an area near Mymensingh town, about 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of
national capital on Monday, and urged Islam to surrender, Hasan told
reporters at the scene.
</P>
<P>
The militants responded with gunfire and then detonated a bomb inside
the house, that ripped the roof off and injured at least seven people,
including Islam and security agents, Lt. Col. Gulzar Uddin, chief
intelligence official of the battalion, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Islam _ who had lost a lot of blood _ was later taken to a government
hospital in Mymensingh town where he was operated on, Abdul Ahad, a
doctor who treated him in the emergency room, told The Associated
Press by phone.
</P>
<P>
Ahad said Islam suffered burns and splinter injuries to his whole
body.
</P>
<P>
Uddin said an agent, also seriously injured in the blast, was taken to
the Dhaka by helicopter for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Islam's wife _ who was detained Sunday night _ apparently led agents
to her husband's hideout, private television station NTV reported.
Hasan could not confirm this.
</P>
<P>
Islam's arrest came five days after his leader Shaikh Abdur Rahman,
head of banned Islamic militant group Jumatul Mujahedeen Bangladesh,
surrendered in northeastern Sylhet city after being surrounded by
security agents.
</P>
<P>
Islam, known as Bangla Bhai or friend of Bangla, gained notoriety in
2004 when he founded an Islamic vigilante group, Jagrata Muslim
Janata, or Vigilant Muslim Citizens, in northern Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The group operated in remote villages, fighting Maoist rebels who were
seeking to turn Muslim-majority Bangladesh into a communist state.
</P>
<P>
It also invoked strict Islamic codes like forcing women to wear veils
and men to grow beards.
</P>
<P>
His group was blamed for killing at least 22 people, including
opposition politicians, in 2004, before joining Rahman's organization
Jumatul Mujahedeen Bangladesh in 2005.
