Pray for your brothers, bin Laden told followers: German court hears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden told his followers in early 2000 to
"pray for your brothers" because an attack was in the offing, a
witness told a German court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Shadi Abdellah, who claims to have been briefly a bodyguard for bin
Laden, said he heard the al-Qaeda mastermind speak while he was
undergoing military training at a camp in Kandahar, southern
Afghanistan, in spring 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Pray for your brothers, there will be an attack," he quoted bin Laden
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Abdellah said it was not explained when, where or how the attack would
take place.
</P>
<P>
Al-Qaeda is blamed for the September 11, 2001 suicide plane hijackings
in the United States which killed more than 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden's words could also be taken to refer to an October 2000
attack on the USS Cole in Yemen which killed 17 sailors.
</P>
<P>
Abdellah was giving evidence in the trial in Hamburg, northern
Germany, of Abdelghani Mzoudi, a Moroccan accused of accessory to
murder and membership of a terrorist organisation in connection with
the September 11 attacks.
</P>
<P>
Abdellah, who is under a state witness protection programme, appeared
as a prosecution witness in a wig and glasses and was surrounded by
police.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Jordanian of Palestinian origin is himself already on
trial in the western German city of Duesseldorf, where he has admitted
being part of a cell that planned attacks against Jewish targets in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Abdellah said he had seen Mzoudi at the Kandahar
camp in Afghanistan in early 2000, although only briefly.
</P>
<P>
If correct, that would support prosecution claims that Mzoudi was
already then involved in preparations for the September 11 attacks.
</P>
<P>
Abdellah said he had also seen Ramzi Binalshibh and Mounir El
Motassadeq at the camp at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Binalshibh, also known as Ramzi bin al-Shaiba, is currently in US
custody. He is accused of playing a major planning role in the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Motassadeq, the first man to be convicted over the September 11
attacks, was jailed by the Hamburg court in February to the maximum 15
years on the same charges facing Mzoudi.
