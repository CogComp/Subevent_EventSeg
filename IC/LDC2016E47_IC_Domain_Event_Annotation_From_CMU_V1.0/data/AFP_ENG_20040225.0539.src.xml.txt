Two dead as US helicopter crashes in western Iraq by Ned Parker

Two American soldiers died as a US helicopter crashed into a river
Wednesday, while Iraq's Governing Council said it would deliver next
week its opinion on a crucial UN report recommending the country
postpone holding national elections.
</P>
<P>
The OH-58 Kiowa helicopter crashed near Haditha, 250 kilometres (150
miles) west of Baghdad, apparently not due to hostile fire, US army
spokesmen said, without confirming the nationality of the dead nor the
number on board.
</P>
<P>
In January, five US military helicopters crashed in Iraq, most downed
by enemy fire.
</P>
<P>
Interim Governing Council member Mohammad Bahr Ulum said Wednesday the
Iraqi legislative body will weigh in next week on the UN findings
about how the country should best proceed on holding elections and
forming a caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
"The council has received the report and decided to submit it for
examination to a special committee and they will deliver a detailed
opinion on the document and give an answer in writing to the United
Nations Secretary General" Kofi Annan, Ulum told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Ulum hails from Iraq's 60 percent Shiite majority, which under the
leadership of its senior clerics rejected the US plan to hold regional
caucuses to choose Iraq's next government.
</P>
<P>
A UN team, headed by Lakhdar Brahimi, visited Iraq earlier this month
at the request of the US-led coalition and Shiite clerics to determine
whether or not elections could be held before June -- which the
Americans claimed was impossible.
</P>
<P>
Annan on Monday finally delivered his report, which rejected both the
US notion of caucuses and the Shiite majority's demand for speedy
elections. Annan warned it would probably take until early 2005 to
conduct polls, citing Iraq's need for an electoral law.
</P>
<P>
A deputy to Ulum also said that the body would meet its Saturday
deadline for completing the transitional law that will rule Iraq after
the country recovers its independence on June 30.
</P>
<P>
The assurances come after Muwaffaq Rubai, an independent Shiite member
of the Governing Council, warned Monday the council would most likely
miss the crucual date.
</P>
<P>
Progress on the transitional law has been stymied by fierce debate
among Governing Council members concerning federalism, women's
representation in a new government and the role of Islamic law in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The coalition, meanwhile, said it was willing to postpone a "status of
forces" agreement until after Iraq receives its sovereignty at the end
of June, a move which could leave US soldiers this summer battling a
dangerous Iraqi insurgency without any deal legitimising their
presence in the country.
</P>
<P>
The US military appeared Wednesday to receive some breaks in the
11-month battle with a tenacious insurgency, grouping loyalists of
Saddam Hussein, criminals, nationalists, Islamic militants and foreign
fighters.
</P>
<P>
US forces said they had uncovered the latest footprint of alleged Al-
Qaeda operative Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi in Iraq after shooting dead one
of his "lieutenants" at a "terrorist safehouse" in the restive western
town of Ramadi last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The noose also tightened on Izzat Ibrahim al-Duri, the highest-ranking
fugitive from the old regime, as US troops and an Iraqi paramilitary
captured three of his associates.
</P>
<P>
Duri, who has a 10-million-dollar price on his head, has been accused
by the Americans of being the nexus of an alliance between Baathists
and Islamic militants waging guerrilla war against post-Saddam Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Polish General Mieczyslaw Bieniek, who commands a
multinational division in central Iraq, was quoted by Polish media as
saying that six men were detained on Tuesday, suspected of involvement
in deadly car bombings in the central towns of Iskandariya and Hilla.
</P>
<P>
In the northern city of Mosul, unknown assailants gunned down in
separate incidents a top police officer and a former member of jailed
dictator Saddam's ruling Baath party, police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, US and Iraqi soldiers detained about 20 people suspected
of posing a "security threat" and seized 175 fifty-five gallon drums
of explosives in a large operation near the health ministry, US
military officials said.
