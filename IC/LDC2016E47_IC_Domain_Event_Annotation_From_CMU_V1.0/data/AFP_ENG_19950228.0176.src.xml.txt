Bloodshed shows up failure of Kurdish self-rule by Patrick Rahir
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bloody car-bomb attack after months of conflict between Kurdish
factions has shown up the failure of four years of self-rule in Iraqi
Kurdistan, diplomats and aid workers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The fighting has stripped the experiment in autonomy of all
credibility," said one diplomat.
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat said bloodshed was on the cards from the very
start, after a May 1992 election resulted in a fragile power-sharing
arrangement between rivals Massud Barzani and Jalal Talabani.
</P>
<P>
Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) has blamed the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK) of Talabani for the car bombing in the border
town of Zakho that killed more than 70 people on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The PUK, meanwhile, pointed the finger at Baghdad, which has been
blamed for all past bombings since the Kurdish factions took control
of northern Iraq in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
To highlight the failure of autonomy and the 50-50 deal between the
PUK and KDP, Amnesty International charged Tuesday that both groups
were responsible for "a human rights crisis."
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds of people -- civilians and combatants taken prisoner -- have
suffered human rights abuses at the hands of forces acting under the
authority of Kurdish political parties," the London-based rights group
said.
</P>
<P>
The KDP and PUK had "perverted the course of justice, preventing any
effective investigations into scores of political assassinations and
killings of prisoners and peaceful demonstrators," said Amnesty.
</P>
<P>
"The knowledge that crime will go unpunished -- and may even be
rewarded -- has contributed to the spiral of violence in society at
large, which has in turn escalated human rights abuses in Iraqi
Kurdistan."
</P>
<P>
Barzani, leader of a feudal family which has fought Baghdad for
decades, and a Talabani, a former KDP man who broke off to found his
own party in 1975, are now "risking their skins in a battle for
supremacy," said an aid worker.
</P>
<P>
They have battled for overall control since May 1994, with the PUK
accusing the KDP of monopolizing customs revenues along the Turkish
border. The clashes have cost more than 400 lives.
</P>
<P>
The biggest losers have been the more than three million Kurds living
in the region, under a double blockade from Baghdad and the UN embargo
in force against the whole of Iraq since its August 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds, traditionally, have had no friends in the region as
neighbouring Turkey, Iran and Syria all have their own Kurdish
minorities which they do not want to encourage to seek autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, which withdrew its forces from Iraqi Kurdistan in 1991, has
offered mediation between the PUK and KDP. But the failure of the
self-rule experiment serves Baghdad's interests.
</P>
<P>
"The 'security zone' imposed by the UN in Kurdistan has become
dangerous for everyone," said Information Minister Yussef Humadi,
referring to an exclusion zone set up north of the 36th parallel to
protect the Kurds from Iraqi attack.
</P>
<P>
"Kurds are pitted against Kurds, Iraqis against Kurds, Turks against
Kurds -- and the American planes just circle overhead without
intervening," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish warplanes enter a "no-fly zone" for Iraqi aircraft in the
north to strike at Turkish rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party
(PKK). Ankara, meanwhile, is pressuring the Iraqi Kurds to reconcile
with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which supports a Kurdish Hezbollah group allied with the KDP,
often shells areas under the control of the PUK.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the outside interference, the United States backs Talabani
but plays the two factions against each other to maintain a balance,
according to an Asian diplomat in Baghdad.
