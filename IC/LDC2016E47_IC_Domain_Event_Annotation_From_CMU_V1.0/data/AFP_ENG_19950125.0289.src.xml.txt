Kurd fighting said to block aid distribution in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Renewed fighting between Kurdish factions in northern Iraq is
preventing shipment and distribution of humanitarian aid to the
region, a Turkish foreign ministry spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal again to the two sides...to end the hostilities," spokesman
Ferhat Ataman said, without giving details on the reported breakdown
in aid efforts.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Kurdish refugees resettled in northern Iraq
after a campaign against them by Baghdad following the Gulf war of
1991.
</P>
<P>
Clashes which have left hundreds dead erupted in May between the rival
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP), which control northern Iraq in defiance of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Almost 500 have been killed since major fighting resumed on December
24, according to Kurdish sources here. There has been no independent
confirmation of the toll.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the official Iranian news agency quoted PUK radio as saying
violent clashes Saturday left more than 20 dead and many wounded in
the Seyed Sadeq region.
</P>
<P>
KDP radio meanwhile reported PUK bombing of Sulaymaniyah, near the
Iranian border, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 Iraqi Kurds demonstrated in the northern Iraqi city
Tuesday to appeal for a halt to the bloodshed in northern Iraq,
according to IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Turkey, where a Kurdish separatist insurrection is underway
in southeastern Anatolia, Ataman charged that a pledge by the
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) to respect Geneva human rights
conventions was "only propaganda from a terrorist organization which
kills women and children."
</P>
<P>
PKK made the commitment -- and denounced what it called "the Turkish
Army's war to destroy the Kurdish people" -- in a statement signed by
its leader Abdullah "Apo" Ocalan and given Tuesday to the
International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva.
