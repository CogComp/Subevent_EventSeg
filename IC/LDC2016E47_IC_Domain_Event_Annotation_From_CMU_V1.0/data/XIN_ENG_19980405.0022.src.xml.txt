JERUSALEM, April 4 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
At least three Palestinians were wounded in East Jerusalem Saturday by
Israeli soldiers as the Palestinians continued protesting the murder
of Hamas bomb maker Muhi Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Palestinian youths held rally in the Abu Dis Arab village in
East Jerusalem to protest against the killing of Sharif. The
protesters later rioted by throwing stones at Israeli soldiers, who
fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse them, Israel Radio
reported.

<P>
Despite Israel's strong denial, Hamas has been accusing Israel of
murdering Sharif, whose burned body was found inside a bombed car.
Some reports said he was killed hours before the car bomb was set off
to cover his assassination.

<P>
At least three protesters were wounded by rubber bullets, but some
reports put the number of injured at six.

Protests were also held in Gaza and several towns in the West Bank. In
Halhul between Jerusalem and Hebron, Israeli armed patrol vehicles
came under stone attacks by Palestinians. The Israeli soldiers fired
rubber bullets and tear gas in response. No injuries were reported.

In Qalqilyah, Palestinian protesters clashed with Israeli soldiers by
throwing stones. The rioting was brought control by Palestinian
police, who arrived to separate the protesters from Israeli soldiers.

<P>
In the biggest rally held in Gaza, over 1,000 pro-Hamas Palestinian
students gathered at the campus of the Islamic University and later
marched through downtown streets of the city. Protesters, waving the
green Hamas flags, chanted anti-Israeli slogans and burned Israeli
flags.
</P>
<P>
They called on the Hamas military wing Izzedin Kassim to launch
attacks against Israeli targets inside and outside Israel to avenge
the death of Sharif, who was killed in a controversial car bombing in
Ramallah last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have been put on high alert across the country
to prevent possible Hamas revenge attacks.
