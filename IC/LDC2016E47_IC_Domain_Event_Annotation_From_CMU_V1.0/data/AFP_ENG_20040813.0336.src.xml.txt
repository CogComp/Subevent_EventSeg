Turkey blames Kurds for blasts, hardliners call for new offensive
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Turkey on Friday blamed Kurdish militants for deadly bombings in
Istanbul amid reports of new threats ahead of the 20th anniversary of
the start of their armed campaign against Ankara.
</P>
<P>
A police official said authorities were now convinced the Tuesday
attacks against two hotels and a gas complex, which left two dead and
11 injured, most of them tourists, were carried out by the former
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), now known as KONGRA-GEL.
</P>
<P>
As the 20th anniversary on Sunday of the PKK uprising approached,
Turkish media reported Friday of a threat of a new urban bombing
campaign by a group of Kurdish militants.
</P>
<P>
The PKK's two-decade armed campaign against the central government in
mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey began on August 15, 1984 with attacks
on security forces in the town of Eruh.
</P>
<P>
Since then the conflict has claimed some 37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Ramazan Er told a news conference Friday that the
authorities believe it was the PKK which carried Tuesday's bombings,
which have been claimed by an extremist organization linked to the Al-
Qaeda network and a previously unknown Kurdish group, the Kurdistan
Freedom Falcons.
</P>
<P>
"The incidents in the hotels in Istanbul are definitely the work of
the PKK/KONGRA-GEL... They sometimes resort to such sections (the
Kurdistan Freedom Falcons) to cover up their deeds," Er said.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons Thursday, in a statement, urged foreign
tourists and investors to leave Turkey, warning that more attacks
would follow.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, police in Istanbul are tracking four Kurd
bomb makers in connection with Tuesday's attacks.
</P>
<P>
The suspects are reportedly loyal to PKK commander Murat Karayilan, a
hardliner who is believed to be one of the main figures behind the
organisation's June decision to call off its five-year ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have since been blamed for some 50 attacks on security
forces in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
Turkish police have intelligence that a group, calling itself "The
August 15 Initiative," is preparing for attacks in big cities, news
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The end of the truce has coincided with a rift among PKK leaders --
some have defected and called for the group's dissolution, while
others have insisted on continuing the armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, most of whom have been hiding in the mountains of
neighboring northern Iraq since the 1999 truce, are also under
pressure by the United States, which has promised Turkey that it will
crack down on them.
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and the European Union, which Turkey is seeking
to join, consider the rebels "terrorists."
</P>
<P>
"August 15 will mark the beginning of a new push... We will resist
conspiracies. That is why the war of legitimate defense should be
sustained," the pro-Kurdish Ozgur Politika newspaper
