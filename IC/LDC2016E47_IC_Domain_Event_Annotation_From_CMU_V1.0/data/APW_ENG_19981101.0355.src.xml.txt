JERUSALEM (AP)
</P>
<P>
Hamas' military wing on Sunday made its first direct threat against
the government of Yasser Arafat, accusing the Palestinian leader of
treason in a move that could signal trouble for the recent Mideast
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
All-out conflict between Arafat's government and the radical Islamic
group could make it extremely difficult to move ahead with the
implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security agreement
signed Oct. 23 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The threat comes three days after Arafat put Hamas' spiritual leader,
Sheik Ahmed Yassin, under house arrest, and as the Palestinians were
said to be hunting a top Hamas military leader.
</P>
<P>
``There is no doubt that Arafat and his repressive security apparatus
have reached the point of treason,'' said the leaflet signed by the
Hamas military arm, the Izzedine al Qassem brigades, and faxed to news
organizations. ``The beginning of infighting has appeared, and no one
can put out its fire.''
</P>
<P>
In the leaflet, Hamas appealed to Arafat to halt an ongoing crackdown
against ``our sons and fighters'' in order to spare Palestinians ``the
horrors...of civil war.''
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office declined to comment
on the leaflet until its authenticity could be verified to its
satisfaction. However, the ornate language, style and phrasing were
extremely similar to past communications from Hamas' military wing.
</P>
<P>
A senior Palestinian security official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, also declined immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
Only last week, Yassin said Hamas does not want a bloody confrontation
with the Palestinian Authority. But that was before the sheik was put
under house arrest following a Hamas claim of responsibility for a
failed suicide bombing on Thursday aimed at Jewish settler children in
the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
None of the children was hurt, but an Israeli soldier was killed when
the military jeep he was riding in intercepted the explosives-rigged
car.
</P>
<P>
In the leaflet, Hamas claimed the army jeep, not the school bus, was
its real target.
</P>
<P>
``We would never target children or the elderly,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Hamas has insisted that its quarrel is only with Israel,
with which it vehemently rejects any peace. However, it has denounced
the peace accord's call for Arafat's government to move concertedly
against Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Arafat launched the wide-ranging crackdown against Hamas even before
Thursday's attack. In recent days, more than 100 Hamas activists have
been rounded up, including several top leaders. Among those jailed was
the group's spokesman, Mahmoud Zahar.
</P>
<P>
Israel has demanded the dismantling of Hamas' military wing and also
the arrest of Mohammed Deif, one of its leaders. Deif, who is blamed
for several terror attacks, has been in hiding in Gaza for three
years.
</P>
<P>
The Gaza Strip's head of security, Abdel Razak Majaydeh, said the
Palestinian Authority was working to apprehend Deif, Israel radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
``Anyone who allows himself to plan or conspire against the hero Deif
or any of our holy warriors will pay a high price,'' the leaflet said.
``There is no room for self-control or silence any more.''
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, before the leaflet appeared, chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat expressed hopes that there would not be an open
clash with Hamas.
</P>
<P>
``I hope all of the 26 Palestinian parties understand that everyone is
allowed to work within the rule of law. If they oppose (the
agreement), that's their business, but they can't do it violently and
cross the red line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in Arafat's government has supported the crackdown.
Communications minister Imad Falouji, a former member of Hamas, on
Saturday said he opposed the arrests and would visit Yassin at home.
