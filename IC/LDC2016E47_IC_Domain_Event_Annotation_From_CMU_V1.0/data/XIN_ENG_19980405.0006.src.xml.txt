JERUSALEM, April 4 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The militant Palestinian group Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas),
held a big rally in Gaza Saturday calling for revenge attacks against
Israel over the death of Hamas bomb maker Muhi Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 pro-Hamas Palestinian students held an anti-Israeli
demonstration at the campus of Gaza's Islamic University and later
marched through central streets in central city. Protesters, waving
the green Hamas flags, chanted anti-Israeli slogans and burned Israeli
flags.
</P>
<P>
They called on the Hamas military wing Izzedin Kassim to launch
attacks against Israeli targets inside and outside Israel to avenge
the death of Sharif, who was killed in a controversial car bombing in
Ramallah last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Despite Israel's strong denial, Hamas has been accusing Israel of
murdering Sharif, whose burned body was found inside a bombed car.
Some reports said he was killed hours before the car bomb was set off
to cover his assassination.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) condemned the
killing of Sharif in a statement issued by the PNA Cabinet which met
Friday night in Ramallah. The statement denounced Sharif' killing as a
"terrible crime," but it did not name who was responsible for his
death. Earlier, the Palestinian Legislative Council issued a
statement, blaming Israel for murdering Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The PNA Cabinet called on Hamas leaders to cooperate with Palestinian
security forces in continuing the investigation into Sharif's death.
It also promised to publish the investigation results once they are
achieved.
</P>
<P>
Following Sharif's death, Palestinian security heads have met with
Hamas political leaders in Gaza in an attempt to prevent Hamas attacks
against Israel. Israeli government has warned that the PNA would be
held responsible for any such attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have been put on high alert throughout the
country to guard against possible terror attacks by Hamas, which has
not launched any attacks in Israel since last September's bombing of
the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police Inspector-General Yehuda Wilk said the current security
alert would continue throughout the upcoming one-week Passover holiday
beginning on Monday and the Independence Day celebrations early next
month.
