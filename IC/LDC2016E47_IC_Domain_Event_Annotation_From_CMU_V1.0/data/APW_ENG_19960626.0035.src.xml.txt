Israel sent condolences to the United States Wednesday for the deaths
of 23 Americans in a Saudi Arabia bombing and said the attack
emphasized the need for an international fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
``I would like to express, in the name of the government of Israel,
deep regret over the lives of American soldiers lost in the Saudi
Arabia attack,'' said Cabinet Secretary Dan Naveh.
</P>
<P>
A powerful truck bomb exploded at a U.S. Air Force complex in Saudi
Arabia Tuesday, killing 23 Americans and injuring about 345. It was
the worst blast involving Americans in the Middle East since the 1983
bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, that killed 241 American servicemen.

``The attack shows the issue we are talking about here, the need to
achieve security,'' said Naveh. ``In a uncompromising struggle against
terrorism we will be able to achieve peace, peace with security.''
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would
resume peace negotiations, but indicated he would bargain hard to
protect Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
After the Saudi attack, Naveh urged more international cooperation in
the fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
``In order to succeed in this an international effort is necessary,
cooperation between all peace-lovers countries, first and foremost
between Israel and the United States,'' Naveh said. ga-nbt
