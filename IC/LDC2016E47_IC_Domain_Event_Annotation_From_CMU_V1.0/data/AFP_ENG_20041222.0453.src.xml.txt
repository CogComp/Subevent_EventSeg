Ansar al-Sunna, fanatics with a penchant for bombings and mutilation

Ansar al-Sunna, a small secretive network of Islamic radicals which
claimed the deadly attack on a US military base in northern Iraq
Tuesday has carried out some of the most gruesome attacks of the
insurgency.
</P>
<P>
The tiny group announced to the world it had carried out the
devastating strike on a packed US army mess hall in Mosul, killing 22
people, among them 14 US soldiers, four US civilians and four Iraqi
security forces. The attack was the deadliest ever against Americans
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The group called the attack a suicide bombing and the US military sent
a team of FBI explosive experts to the scene to determine whether or
not the Islamic militant group had actually penetrated their base or
just got lucky lobbing a rocket or mortar at the US base.
</P>
<P>
"One of the mujahedeen of the Army of Ansar al-Sunna carried out a
martyrdom-seeking (suicide) operation in a restaurant of the infidel
occupation forces at the Ghazlani camp in Mosul," the group said in a
website statement, whose authenticity could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
ABC News, quoting unidentified government sources, reported that "a
backpack found by investigators at the site and remnants of a torso
indicate the attack was caused by a suicide bombing".
</P>
<P>
Ansar al-Sunna is a splinter faction that broke away from another
fundamentalist group called Ansar al-Islam. Both movements espouse a
puritanical vision of Islam, redolent of that of Afghanistan's
Taliban, for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Both factions are believed to have links with the Jordanian-born
fugitive Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who is widely credited by US and Iraqi
officials with introducing the scourge of suicide attacks and car
bombings to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ansar al-Islam was formed in September 2001 in the northern Kurdish
province of Sulaimaniyah when a collection of Kurdish Islamist
factions joined forces.
</P>
<P>
The group was joined by Arab Islamists in the mountains along Iraqi
Kurdistan's Iranian border after the militants quit Afghanistan's
celebrated Jihad training camps in autumn 2001, faced with the US war
on the fundamentalist Taliban and the Al-Qaeda terror group.
</P>
<P>
US officials believe that Zarqawi set up shop at the mountain base of
Ansar al-Islam sometime after the Taliban regime's collapse.
</P>
<P>
With the US invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Ansar al-Islam splintered
as the group was evicted from its Kurdish mountain base. Some members
fled to Iran but eventually returned to Iraq in the chaos of the US-
led occupation.
</P>
<P>
The group gradually set up underground networks across northern Iraq
by late summer 2003. However, some members decided by early 2004 to
form Ansar al-Sunna.
</P>
<P>
The group's most infamous act before Tuesday's strike in Mosul was the
August execution of 12 Nepalese labourers in Iraq, with the gory video
footage of their execution posted on an Internet site.
</P>
<P>
The group also claimed in September the execution of three Kurds taken
hostage in Taji, north of Baghdad. Footage of the bodies, with slit
throats, was also posted on the Internet. The group also claimed the
execution of 11 Iraqi national guardsmen.
</P>
<P>
However, both Ansar al-Sunna and Ansar al-Islam have lost some
recruits to Zarqawi's larger organisation Unity and Holy War, a US
military intelligence officer told AFP in July. The movements still
have links to Zarqawi's organisation.
