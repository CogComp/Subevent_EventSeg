SRI LANKANS STUNNED BY LATEST WAVE OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka  -NYT)

<P>
As Sri Lankans struggled this week to cope with the suicide bombing
that killed the country's main opposition leader and dozens of others
at a political rally, many found a focus for their grief in a moment
that one newspaper called the ``gathering of the widows.''
</P>
<P>
In an encounter that encapsulated the melancholy that has settled on
this country like a shroud, three women who lost their husbands in
previous political killings met on Wednesday by the rainswept bier of
Gamini Dissanayake, the slain opposition leader, to console his widow,
Srima. The brief meeting, at an open-air pavilion at the country's
parliamentary complex, was wordless.
</P>
<P>
Leading the widows was Prime Minister Chandrika Kumaratunga, whose
husband was shot dead six years ago. Also in the group was Mrs.
Kumaratunga's mother, Sirimavo Bandaranaika, who became the world's
first female prime minister in 1959 after her husband, also prime
minister, was shot dead by a Buddhist monk.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has billed itself in travel brochures as a ``fantasy
island'' of graceful Buddhist and Hindu temples, south sea beaches and
swaying palms. But nowadays, many in this island nation see themselves
not so much blessed as cursed, by a seemingly endless cycle of
bombings and shootings and massacres, many of them, like the latest,
carried out with a ferocity that seems to have taken on a grisly logic
of its own.
</P>
<P>
``A dozen leaders you worked closely with, whose families you knew,
all killed -- it eats into your very being,'' said Neelam Tiruchelvam,
a 50-year-old Harvard-educated lawyer who knew Dissanayake since the
two were schoolboys.
</P>
<P>
After a moment's silence, Tiruchelvam added: ``They say it's immoral
to be pessimistic at a time of moral crisis. But events like this
induce a sense of helplessness.''
</P>
<P>
The despair felt by many here runs beyond the 11-year civil war that
has pitted the majority population of ethnic Sinhalese, mostly
Buddhists, against the rebel group suspected of having killed
Dissanayake, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, who are renowned for the brutality of their tactics,
including suicide bombings, are fighting for a separate state in
northern and eastern Sri Lanka for the country's minority of ethnic
Tamils, mostly Hindus, who make up about 12 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
The war has killed at least 40,000 people since it began in 1983. But
at times it has been a sideshow to other eruptions of political
violence in which the main perpetrators, and victims, have been ethnic
Sinhalese.
</P>
<P>
Then, in the late 1980s, the government army and police went to war
against an extreme Sinhalese nationalist group, the Janatha Vimukthi
Peramuna. From 1987 to 1990, the two sides engaged in a deadly trade
of assassination, massacre and torture in which 20,000 to 60,000
people are said to have been killed.
</P>
<P>
The two conflicts gave birth to a wider cult of violence. Hardly a day
goes by when newspapers here do not chronicle killings that have grown
out of political rivalries, ethnic or religious tensions, or gang
warfare that is rife in Colombo and other major cities.
</P>
<P>
Shootings or knifings are the exception. Often, the victims are pushed
into burning cars, hacked to death with machetes, or tortured to death
over hours or days. Often, their children die with them.
</P>
<P>
But few recent events have stunned Sri Lanka's 18 million people more
than Monday morning's blast. Just past midnight Sunday, as the 52
-year-old Dissanayake closed the rally in a Colombo suburb by bidding
the crowd a cheery ``Good morning,'' a young woman with braided hair
stepped forward, positioned herself 10 feet from the platform, and
reached beneath her T-shirt to detonate a bomb.
</P>
<P>
The bomb, laced with 10 pounds of ball bearings, killed 54 people and
wounded more than 100, many critically. Among the dead were three
former Cabinet ministers, seven police officers, and several wives and
daughters of leading political figures, as well as many others on the
platform and in the front rows of the crowd. The head of the suicide
bomber, who remains unidentified, was found more than 80 feet away, on
a second-story rooftop.
</P>
<P>
The blast threw Sri Lanka's political landscape into chaos for the
second time in 18 months. During a May Day procession through Colombo
last year, President Ranasinghe Premadasa was killed with more than 20
others by a suicide bomber on a bicycle, apparently sent by the Tiger
rebels.
</P>
<P>
A week earlier, a man who had been widely touted as the country's
future leader, Lalith Athulathmudali, a political partner of
Dissanayake, was shot dead at another rally. That killing, too, was
blamed on the Tigers, though many here believe it may have been
ordered by Premadasa. Athulathmudali's widow, Srimani, was one of the
widows who gathered at Dissanayake's bier this week.
</P>
<P>
The earlier killings left Dissanayake on a short list of middle-age
politicians considered capable of running the government. His United
National Party, a conservative grouping that had governed for 17
years, narrowly lost a general election in August to a left-of-center
coalition headed by Mrs. Kumaratunga. It was hoping to make a comeback
in the presidential election on Nov. 9, in which the two main
candidates were to have been Mrs. Kumaratunga and Dissanayake.
</P>
<P>
Now, the United National Party's candidate will be Mrs. Dissanayake, a
50-year-old lawyer, who will be continuing the tradition of widows'
stepping into politics that was started 35 years ago by Mrs.
Bandaranaika, Mrs. Kumaratunga's mother.
</P>
<P>
In a measure of how democracy here has been inhibited by violence,
both Mrs. Kumaratunga and Mrs. Dissanayake have said they will hold no
further public rallies before the election.
</P>
<P>
But for many Sri Lankans, who wins the presidency has become almost
irrelevant. As middle-class families gathered this week, searching for
explanations for the violence, the talk was more of culture and
psychology than of the election. One prominent physician stunned
guests at dinner into silence when he interrupted a discussion to say,
``If you ask me, what this country needs is a crash program in mental
health.''
