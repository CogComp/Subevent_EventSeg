<P>
Defence Minister Shaul Mofaz  said Tuesday Israel would intensify its
bombardments of Gaza, as  Palestinian premier Ismail Haniya accused
Israel of trying to bring  the Palestinian people to their knees.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen Palestinians have been killed since Friday night by  Israeli
air strikes and tank shelling designed to put a permanent  halt to
repeated salvoes of makeshift missiles fired by hardline  factions
such as Islamic Jihad and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades.
</P>
<P>
The latest victim was an eight-year-old girl who died on Monday  when
an Israeli shell struck a house in the Beit Lahiya region of  northern
Gaza. A seven-year-old boy was also killed in an air strike  on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli ministers, while expressing regret over the deaths,  made
clear Tuesday that there would be no easing off in the military
activity.
</P>
<P>
"As long as calm does not prevail on the Israeli side, neither  will
it do so on the Palestinian side," said the defence minister.  "Our
operations are going to intensify."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni struck a similarly uncompromising  line.
</P>
<P>
"The role of the Israeli army is to defend Israeli civilians,  combat
terrorism and prevent rocket attacks," she told public radio.  "As
long as Palestinians fire at residential areas, the army must  reply."
</P>
<P>
But Haniya said the bombardments were clearly designed to  shatter the
will of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
"The bombardments in the north of the Gaza Strip and in  (southern)
Khan Yunis ... are part of a political and economic siege  of the
Palestinian people," said Haniya, whose Hamas movement came  to power
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"This is an attempt to bring the Palestinian people to their  knees
and strangle the government which was democratically elected,"  he
added.
</P>
<P>
Both Jihad and Al-Aqsa insisted they would not be cowed into
submission.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue firing rockets in response to the crimes and
Israeli aggressions, namely their assassinations and bombardments
against the Palestinian people," Al-Aqsa Brigades spokesman Abu  Ahmed
told AFP.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Jihad, the most hardline of all the Palestinian
factions, said the movement would "continue to respond to the  Israeli
aggression by any means."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas said that his  office had
been in contact with the Israeli government over the  bombardments.
</P>
<P>
"We are making these contacts to stop the Israeli escalation in
Gaza," he said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
A senior military source said a fall in the number of rocket  attacks
had already been detected and that their effectiveness had  been
diminished.
</P>
<P>
"At this stage our action has proved to be effective. There were  two
incidents today when Qassam (rocket) launchers backtracked  because of
our artillery. There are more rockets falling in  Palestinian areas
because they need to hurry," he told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The officer said plans had been drawn up for a ground operation,  but
any such move would require approval from government ministers.
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a fantasy. One of the reasons we planned this
intermediate stage was to avoid a ground operation. There are other
means that should be used before going in."
</P>
<P>
Israel withdrew all its ground troops from the Gaza Strip last
September and its bombardments of the territory have been either  from
the air or sea or by tank shelling from across the border.  Livni
acknowledged that such tactics could have tragic  consequences.
</P>
<P>
The Gaza head of the United Nations agency for Palestinian  refugees,
John Ging, expressed "great concern" over the situation  after
visiting UN-run schools which he feared could end up in the  firing
line.
</P>
<P>
"There are very real concerns and we want this to be taken into
account," he said.
