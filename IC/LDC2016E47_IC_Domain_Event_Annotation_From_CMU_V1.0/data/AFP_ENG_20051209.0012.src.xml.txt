Three blasts in southeast Turkey: police
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three blasts went off almost  simultaneously in a town in mainly
Kurdish southeast Turkey Friday,  injuring at least one person and
causing material damage, officials  and press reports said.
</P>
<P>
The blasts ocurred outside shops at three separate locations in
Silopi, at the Iraqi border, in the province of Sirnak, local police
told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Two blasts went off simultaneously at around 8:30 pm (1830 GMT),
while the third followed in about 15 minutes, the pro-Kurdish Firat
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia news agency said one person was  wounded,
while Firat reported several injured.
</P>
<P>
The blasts followed a police operation in Silopi earlier this  week in
which two suspected Kurdish rebels and seven accomplices  were
detained on suspicion that they were planning "simultaneous
sensational bombings/armed attacks," according to an official
statement.
</P>
<P>
The security forces also seized weapons and about a kilogram  (2.2
pounds) of plastic explosives in the homes of the suspects and  a
member of Silopi's township council, identified by the media as  the
town's Kurdish deputy mayor who remained at large and was wanted  by
the police.
</P>
<P>
Unrest in the southeast rose noticeably this year after the  rebel
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), blacklisted as a terrorist  group by
Turkey, the European Union and the United States, called  off a five-
year unilateral ceasefire in June 2004.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish conflict in Turkey has claimed some 37,000 lives  since
1984 when the PKK took up arms for Kurdish self-rule in the
southeast.
