NEW DELHI, Aug. 6 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
A lone militant struck at Amarnath pilgrim's base camp early Tuesday
morning at Nunwan near Pahalgam in India-controlled Jammu and Kashmir,
killing eight of them and injuring 32 others in their sleep.
</P>
<P>
Appearing from the nearby hillock, the militant, believed to be a
foreign mercenary and dressed in Gujjar attire, tore the three- tier
security setup and launched the surprise attack at 5.20 a.m., hurling
grenades and firing indiscriminately from an AK-47 rifle for a few
minutes before he was shot dead by security persons.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the militant struck when the pilgrims were sleeping
at the base camp, from where devotees begin their mountainous trek to
reach the Amarnath cave shrine.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen of those seriously injured have been hospitalized in Srinagar
while others have been admitted to different hospitals in south
Kashmir district of Anantnag.
</P>
<P>
No militant outfit has claimed the responsibility for the attack, the
second within a week on pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
Officials did not rule out involvement of Pakistan-based militant
outfits Lashkar-i-Toiba and Jaish-e Mohammad in the attack as dominant
local Hizbul Mujahideen group had announced that it would not disrupt
the pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
The attack triggered panic and the authorities temporarily suspended
the pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the attack, security forces cordoned off the area
and were combing the hills for other militants.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the slain militant was suspected to be a foreign
mercenary as his AK-47 rifle bore the inscription "Islamic Library
Lahore" and "ya allah mujai madad kar (Oh God help me)."
</P>
<P>
This was the second attack on the pilgrims this year. On July 30, two
pilgrims were killed and five others injured when militants exploded a
powerful grenade in Anantnag inside a vehicle carrying devotees from
Uttar Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indian Home Ministry Tuesday rushed a team of senior
officials to Jammu and Kashmir for an on-the-spot assessment of
terrorist attack on Amarnath pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Home I.D. Swami said, "We are determined to
continue the Amarnath yatra (pilgrimage). The yatra will continue."
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that security arrangements would be reviewed and
further tightened.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, militants struck the pilgrimage in Pahalgam, killing
over 23 pilgrims and 10 civilians in the biggest ever strike on the
Amarnath route.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrimage became the target of militants since 1994 when Harkat-
ul-Ansar outfit threatened the pilgrims and carried out several
attacks on them in their bid to disrupt the annual ritual.
