<P>
A radical Kurdish militant  group, blamed for bomb attacks in the
past, took credit for an  explosion Thursday that injured 16 people in
an Internet cafe  frequented by police officers in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The police chief in Turkey's biggest city, Celalettin Cerrah,  said
they suspected a bomb caused the blast that rocked the  Bayrampasa
district on the European side of the city straddling the  Bosphorus
Strait.
</P>
<P>
"It looks like it (the blast) was caused by explosives," Cerrah  told
reporters at the scene, the Anatolia news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Europe-based, pro-Kurdish Firat news agency reported on its
website that an anonymous person claimed responsibility for the  blast
on behalf of the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK) in a  telephone call
to the agency.
</P>
<P>
No other details were available. The agency often carries  statements
by Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
The explosion ripped through the cafe located behind the local
headquarters of the riot police and frequented by officers at 2:05
p.m. (1205 GMT), blowing out the windows of nearby buildings.
</P>
<P>
Following initial reports that 17 people were injured, the
government's emergency office and Cerrah put the number hurt at 16,
including seven policemen and nine civilians, two of whom were in
serious condition, Cerrah said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials say TAK is a cover group used by the outlawed
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) to carry out attacks on civilian
targets that would draw international condemnation.
</P>
<P>
The PKK, however, denies any link to TAK, which was blamed for a
series of bomb attacks last year, including one in the Aegean resort
of Kusadasi in July that killed five people, including two foreign
tourists.
</P>
<P>
The PKK, blacklisted as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the
United States and the European Union, has been fighting the Ankara
government since 1984 when it picked up arms for self-rule in the
country's mainly Kurdish southeast. The conflict has claimed some
37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Unrest in the southeast of Turkey has increased markedly since  last
year after the PKK called off a five-year unilateral ceasefire  in
June 2004.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's blast followed reports that PKK's jailed leader  Abdullah
Ocalan had suffered a heart attack in prison, which Turkish  officials
denied.
</P>
<P>
The PKK and its sympathizers have often expressed concern over
Ocalan's health and staged violent protests calling for him to be
removed from solitary confinement on the prison island of Imrali in
northwestern Turkey, where the 57-year-old rebel chieftain is the
sole inmate.
</P>
<P>
A senior PKK commander said Thursday that anger was boiling  within
the group over Ocalan's conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Our anger is at a peak point, the guerrilla forces are  outraged,"
Duran Kalkan told the Firat news agency. "Those who have  put Ocalan
into a process of annihilation are playing with fire."
