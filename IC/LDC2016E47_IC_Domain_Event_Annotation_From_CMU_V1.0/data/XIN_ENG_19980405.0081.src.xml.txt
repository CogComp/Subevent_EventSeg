JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Israel is expecting the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to clear
its name in the alleged assassination of Hamas bombmaker Muhei Eddine
Sharif, Israel Radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has promised to publish the results of its probe into the
mysterious death of Sharif, whose deformed body was found inside a car
that exploded last Sunday in the West Bank city Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Israel hopes the PNA investigation would exonerate its alleged
involvement in Sharif's death so as to reduce the motivation of
Islamic Resistance Movement for launching terror attacks against it.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has blamed Israeli agents for killing Sharif before blowing up
the car to cover up the murder. It vowed to avenge Sharif's killing by
carrying out suicide attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
But the militant group is also suspecting that Palestinian police
might have carried out the assassination in collaboration with Israel.
Hamas leader in Gaza Abdel Rantisi hinted Saturday that Sharif was
arrested and tortured to death by the Palestinian security forces
before they used the car bombing to cover up the killing.
</P>
<P>
The PNA originally held Israel responsible for murdering Sharif, but
it later revised the position following Israel's strong denial of any
involvement.
</P>
<P>
Israeli General Security Service head Ami Ayalon and Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's attorney Yithzak Molcho have met secretly with
PNA President Yasser Arafat in Gaza Strip to drive home that Israel
had nothing to do with the killing.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu warned Friday that Israel would hold the PNA responsible for
any Hamas attacks if it continued accusing Israel of plotting the
murder.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday, the PNA Cabinet said it is now
investigating the possibility that Sharif was killed by other Hamas
members due to inner split.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has reportedly been trying to placate Hamas to forestall terror
attacks against Israel, fearing Israel could find excuses to torpedo
the already stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has so far rejected the PNA's claim on Hamas' inner feud and the
demand for restraint, vowing to avenge the death of Sharif with blood-
shed.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Hamas rally in Gaza Saturday, Rantisi called on Hamas'
military wing Izzedin Kassim, which is responsible for the past
suicide bombings in Israel, to continue its struggle against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have been on high alert to guard against
possible terror attacks by Hamas, which has suspended operations
against Israel since its spiritual leader and founder Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin was released from Israeli jail last October.
