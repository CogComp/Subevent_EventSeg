<P>
The alleged chief of an Al-Qaeda cell in  Spain believed to have
helped prepare the September 11 attacks was  hospitalized Friday
morning after being attacked by fellow  prisoners, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
While his injuries were not serious, Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas,  alias
Abu Dahdah, was admitted to hospital in the eastern city of  Castellon
for a complete medical examination, the Spanish prison  administration
told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dahdah and 23 other co-defendants face record jail terms of
74,377 years for their alleged involvement in preparing the  September
11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington in which some  3,000
people were killed.
</P>
<P>
During breakfast on Friday Abu Dahdah was insulted by a fellow
prisoner, and then attacked after guards ordered inmates out of the
cafeteria, a prison administration spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The authorities were still trying to determine the perpetrators  of
the attack.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dahdah had just arrived at the Castellon prison Thursday  evening
from Madrid where the trial was held from April to the  beginning of
July. A verdict is expected to be handed down in  September.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors accuse Abu Dahdah and his cell of helping prepare  the
September 11 attacks following a meeting in July 2001 in Spain
believed to have been attended by Mohammed Atta, the ringleader of
the hijackers who attacked the World Trade Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
He has denied the charges against him and claimed the trial to  be a
farce.
