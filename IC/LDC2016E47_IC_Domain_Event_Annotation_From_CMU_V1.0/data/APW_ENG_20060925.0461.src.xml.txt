<P>
A Kurdish guerrilla group claimed responsibility for a weekend bomb
attack that injured 17 people in eastern Turkey, a pro-Kurdish news
agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The armed wing of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, said on its Web
site that it was behind Saturday's attack near a police guest house in
the eastern city of Igdir, according to the Firat news agency.
</P>
<P>
The group also claimed responsibility for another bombing Saturday
that derailed a freight train in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In latest reported violence, the rebels ambushed a Turkish military
unit, killing a lieutenant on Sunday night near the town of Dargecit
in Mardin province, the governor's office announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have intensified their attacks across the country and have
so far ignored a recent call by the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society
Party to declare a unilateral cease-fire in the hopes of establishing
dialogue with the state.
</P>
<P>
The violence also comes amid new efforts by Turkey, the United States
and Iraq to counter the rebels, who are based in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, himself a Kurd, said in the United
States that the PKK could declare a new cease-fire in the coming days,
Turkey's state-owned Anatolia news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We convinced the PKK to stop fighting, and within days it will
officially announce a cease-fire," Anatolia quoted Talabani as saying.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the PKK's estimated 5,000 guerrillas are thought to be in
Turkey, but many operate in Iraq and Iran. The guerrillas have
benefited from the years of a power vacuum in northern Iraq to stage
cross-border offensives on Turkish targets.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the guerrilla group heeded a similar call from the pro-
Kurdish party, but the rebels ended their unilateral truce more than a
month later, saying the government had failed to recognize the rebel
group and was maintaining its military drive against its members.
</P>
<P>
The PKK's longest unilateral cease-fire declared after the capture of
its leader Abdullah Ocalan in 1999 lasted five years. The rebels
resumed fighting in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly said it will not negotiate with terrorists, and
will fight until all rebels are killed or surrender. The PKK is also
listed as a terrorist organization by the United States and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's attacks also coincided with complaints by Ocalan about his
prison conditions, which were relayed by his lawyers and reported by
the Firat news agency.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas have lately intensified their attacks, carrying out
bombings in Mediterranean resorts that killed at least three people
and wounded dozens. One of the attacks, a minibus bombing in the
popular resort town of Marmaris, wounded 10 Britons in late August.
</P>
<P>
Turkish authorities have said more than 90 soldiers have been killed
in PKK attacks since the beginning of this year, and 472 civilians
have been killed or injured, a dramatic increase over past years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and EU have called on Turkey to improve the economy of the
war-ravaged southeastern Turkey to end the 22-year-old conflict, which
has killed 37,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been trying to improve its treatment of Turkish Kurds under
pressure from the EU and has granted more cultural rights, such as the
right to broadcast in the once-banned Kurdish language.
