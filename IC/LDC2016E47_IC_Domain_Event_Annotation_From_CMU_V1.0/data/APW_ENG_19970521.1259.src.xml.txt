<P>
Maoist Shining Path guerrillas opened fire on two police officers,
killing one and seriously wounding the other, continuing a series of
guerrilla attacks, police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The attack happened late Tuesday night in the poor district of
Lurigancho in northeast Lima when four guerrillas opened fire on the
policemen from a speeding car, police said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, two small fire bombs went off in a movie theater in
the middle-class Lima district of San Borja, but no injuries were
reported.
</P>
<P>
The bombs set fire to several seats and part of the theater's carpet,
but the fire was controlled by employees with fire extinguishers.
</P>
<P>
Police said the bombs were left by two people seen rapidly leaving the
theater before the explosions and it was done ``in the style'' of the
Shining Path.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas also hung a Shining Path banner with the hammer-and-sickle
on a hill in Lurigancho, surrounding it with seven homemade bombs,
police said. The bombs were deactivated by the police.
</P>
<P>
The latest series of guerrilla attacks began May 15 when a powerful
Shining Path car bomb ripped through the front of a police station in
Lima's industrial suburb of Ate-Vitarte wounding 25 people, including
eight police officers.
</P>
<P>
It was the first Shining Path car bomb since July 1996.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, guerrillas shot and wounded a police officer in Lima's port
city Callao.
</P>
<P>
Experts on the rebel movement had predicted attacks as the Shining
Path tries to re-establish its reputation as Peru's dominant rebel
group, following a four-month hostage crisis led by the smaller rival
Tupac Amaru group.
</P>
<P>
All 14 Tupac Amaru rebels were killed in the April 22 rescue by
military commandos that freed 72 hostages who had been held for 126
days by the rebels in the Japanese ambassador's residence.
</P>
<P>
Political violence committed by the Shining Path has fallen sharply
since its leader and founder, Abimael Guzman, was captured in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Although more than 30,000 people have been killed on both sides since
the Shining Path launched its insurgency in 1980, rebels killed fewer
than 200 people in 1996.
