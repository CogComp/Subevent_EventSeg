Ten killed, 17 wounded in Somaliland fighting
</HEADLINE>

<P>
At least ten people were killed and 17 others wounded in new clashes
between loyalist and opposition forces in the breakaway republic of
Somaliland, bringing to 69 the death toll in the violence this week,
radio reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to field radios monitored here, fighting flared up when
rebels forces attacked Somaliland's main airport, five kilometres
(three miles), south of the self-proclaimed republic's capital
Hargeisa on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Government troops are deployed at the airport to defend it against
attacks by the rebel Somali National Movement (SNM), headed by
Abdurahman Ahmed Ali "Tuur".
</P>
<P>
An SNM spokesman in Mogadishu claimed his fighters had captured
Hargeisa airport. But there were no independent confirmation of the
allegation.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the two sides on Monday left 59 people killed and 130
wounded, and Burco, the second biggest city in the region, devastated.
</P>
<P>
Somaliland, a former British colony, split off from the rest of
Somalia, formerly Italian, when dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was
overthrown in 1991, but it has received no international recognition.
</P>
<P>
Tuur was Somaliland's first president, but was ousted by elders in
1993 in favour of the current President Mohamed Ibrahim Egal.
</P>
<P>
Tuur has since become a vice president in the Somali "government"
proclaimed by Mogadishu warlord General Mohamed Farah Aidid last June
and favours reunification.
</P>
<P>
The fighting is threatening to hamper the work of relief agencies
still operating in the region.
