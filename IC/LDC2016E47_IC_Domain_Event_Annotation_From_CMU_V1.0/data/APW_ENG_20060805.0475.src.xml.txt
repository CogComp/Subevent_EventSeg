ANKARA, Turkey

<P>
A militant Kurdish group claimed responsibility Saturday for two
bombings in southern Turkey that injured 17 people.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons said in a statement on their Web site
that the two blasts Friday were in retaliation for actions by Turkish
security forces. Kurdish guerrillas have recently escalated their
attacks against Turkish targets, and Turkish security forces have been
cracking down against militants.
</P>
<P>
The first blast occurred in front of a bank on a busy road in the city
of Adana, injuring two bank employees. The second explosion occurred
about 10 minutes later a few meters (yards) away and injured police
who had rushed to the site of the first blast.
</P>
<P>
Rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK have been fighting for
autonomy since 1984, and some 37,000 people have been killed as a
result of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons are believed to be linked to the PKK.
Unlike the PKK, which has largely concentrated its attacks against
security forces in the overwhelmingly rural and Kurdish southeast of
Turkey, the Falcons appear mostly to be based in urban areas and have
largely carried out attacks against civilian targets.
