Four Killed In Car Bombing That Shows Guerrillas Recovering Potential

</P>
<P>
A car bomb exploded outside a luxury casino-hotel Wednesday, killing
four people and injuring 13 in Peru's worst attack in nearly three
years.
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred at 4:15 a.m. outside the Hotel Maria Angola,
destroying the front of the 10-story luxury hotel and casino in the
Miraflores section of Lima.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but most bombings in
Peru have been linked to the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla group
that usually operates deep in the interior.
</P>
<P>
``The attack reminds us that the Shining Path still exists,'' said
Raul Gonzales, an expert on the group, which has been fighting an
armed insurgency since 1980.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales said the attack indicates the Shining Path may have resolved
some of the internal division that followed the 1992 capture of its
founder, Abimael Guzman.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said two men and a woman were arrested after the
bombing, following a chase and shootout.
</P>
<P>
Marco Rosell, head of hotel security, said the four dead worked for
the hotel. They were identified as two security guards, a casino
employee and a cook in the hotel's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
The hotel said about 80 guests were staying in the hotel and about 30
people were in the casino when the bomb went off.
</P>
<P>
Police said the attackers set off 50 kilograms (100 pounds) of
dynamite in a car parked in front of the 125-room hotel. Earlier
reports said the bomb was 100 kilograms (200 pounds).
</P>
<P>
``It is the most important Shining Path attack since the fall of
Abimael Guzman,'' Gonzales said. He said the bombing was symbolically
situated only two blocks from Tarata Street, scene of Peru's worst
terrorist bombing three years ago. Twenty-five people were killed in
that attack.
</P>
<P>
Political violence has dropped sharply since Guzman was captured and
sentence to life in prison, although sporadic attacks continue. But
Gonzales said the Shining Path no longer poses a risk to the country's
economic and political stability.
</P>
<P>
President Alberto Fujimori has pledged to eliminate the Shining Path
by the end of his first term on July 28, when he will be sworn in for
another five years.
</P>
<P>
But experts, who estimate that the Shining Path may still have 1,000
combatants in several rural strongholds, doubt he will accomplish that
goal.
</P>
<P>
David Montoya, an expert on the Shining Path for Peru's Center for
Development Studies and Promotion, said his organization has noticed
an increase in the Shining Path's activities in rural areas over the
last three months.
</P>
<P>
He said the Shining Path was actively recruiting in Lima, but does not
have a solid military presence here.
</P>
<P>
``It cannot risking trying a wave of bombings, but it can carry out
this type of action,'' Montoya said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first bombing to cause deaths in Peru this year and comes a
week after the 15th anniversary of the beginning of the Shining Path's
armed struggle, which started May 17, 1980, when guerrillas burned
ballot boxes in a remote highland village.
</P>
<P>
The Shining Path traditionally marks important anniversaries with
attacks. Since 1980, political violence in Peru has claimed nearly
30,000 lives.
