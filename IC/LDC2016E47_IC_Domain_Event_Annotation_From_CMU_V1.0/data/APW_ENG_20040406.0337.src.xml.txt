</P>
<P>
A radical Shiite cleric sought by U.S. forces said Tuesday he is
willing to die resisting any attempt to capture him, while battles
between gunmen and coalition forces in Shiite cities in the south
killed at least 30 Iraqis and one soldier and wounded dozens.
</P>
<P>
Followers of Muqtada al-Sadr clashed with British troops in the city
of Amarah in battles late Monday that killed 15 Iraqis and wounded
eight, said a coalition spokesman in the city, Wun Hornbyckle.
</P>
<P>
Gunmen also traded fire with Italian forces in Nasiriyah on Tuesday.
Coalition spokeswoman Paola Della Casa told the Apcom news agency in
Rome that 15 Iraqis were killed and 35 others wounded. The city saw
clashed two days ago between al-Sadr militiamen and Italians
</P>
<P>
A Ukrainian soldier was killed and five wounded in clashes with
militants in the city of Kut, the Defense Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sadr, a 30-year-old cleric who frequently denounces the U.S.-led
occupation in his sermons and his built a private militia, called on
his followers to ``defend their rights'' against U.S.-led forces.
</P>
<P>
``America has shown its evil intentions, and the proud Iraqi people
cannot accept it. They must defend their rights by any means they see
fit,'' al-Sadr said in a statment released by his office.
</P>
<P>
Fearing a U.S. move to capture him, al-Sadr's aides said Tuesday he
had moved from the fortress-like mosque in the city of Kufa where he
had been holed up for the past two days to his office in the nearby
holy city of Najaf, south of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The United States declared an ``outlaw'' after his militiamen battled
coalition troops Sunday in Baghdad and outside Najaf in fights that
killed 61 people  _  including eight U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials announced an arrest warrant against al-Sadr on Monday,
suggesting they would move soon to detain him.
</P>
<P>
Three U.S. soldiers were killed in attacks Monday and Tuesday in a
northern Baghdad neighborhood near an area that saw clashes Monday
between al-Sadr militiamen and Americans, the military said  _  though
it was not immediately clear whether they were killed by al-Sadr
supporters.
</P>
<P>
The showdown with al-Sadr could raise tensions with Iraq's Shiite
majority. U.S. officials appear to be counting on Shiites not to rally
around al-Sadr, who is widely distrusted within his community for his
youth and radicalism.
</P>
<P>
But the clashes Monday and Tuesday suggested that even without
widespread popular support, his al-Mahdi Army militia can put up a
fight.
</P>
<P>
At least 11 Iraqis were killed overnight by blasts in Sadr City, a
mostly Shiite neighborhood in Baghdad that saw some of the fiercest
fighting Sunday between militiamen and U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
A top al-Sadr aide, Sheik Qays al-Khaz'ali, said Tuesday that al-Sadr
had moved to his main office, in Najaf.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, dozens of heavily armed militiamen were outside the Najaf
office, located in a small alley near Shiism's holiest site, the
golden-domed shrine of Imam Ali. The black-garbed gunmen, some
carrying rocket-propelled grenade launchers, crowded the narrow alley
and roamed nearby streets.
</P>
<P>
There was no way to confirm reports that al-Sadr was inside.
</P>
<P>
Asked if al-Sadr will resist if U.S. forces come to arrest him, al-
Khaz'ali replied: ``God forbid if this happens, al-Sayed will win
martyrdom''  _     referring to al-Sadr by an Arabic title meaning
``master.''
</P>
<P>
Al-Khaz'ali quoted al-Sadr as saying, ``My fate will be either
assassination or arrested.''
</P>
<P>
A move from Kufa to Najaf would be an unusual move. Al-Sadr is widely
unpopular in Najaf, where most Shiites support older, more moderate
clerics. By contrast, his al-Mahdi Army has been in virtual control of
Kufa since Sunday, holding the police station and patrolling the
streets. His gunmen were out in force around the main mosque in Kufa,
which has high, fortresslike walls.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released earlier by his office, al-Sadr said he was
moving to avoid bloodshed in the Kufa mosque. ``I feared that the
sanctity of a glorious and esteemed mosque would be violated by scum
and evil people,'' he said. The Americans ``will have no qualms to
embark on such actions.''
</P>
<P>
``I have pledged not to allow a drop of blood to be shed except my
own,'' al-Sadr said. ``I'm prepared to have my own blood shed for what
is holy to me.''
</P>
<P>
He also denounced U.S. President George W. Bush, who said Monday that
al-Sadr aimed at wrecking democracy in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
``I would like to direct my words to the father of evil, Bush,'' al-
Sadr said. ``Who is against democracy? Is it the one who calls for
peaceful resistance or the one who bombs people, sheds their blood and
leads them away from the leaders under feeble and dirty pretexts?''
</P>
<P>
The arrest warrant was issued on charges al-Sadr was involved in the
slaying of a rival cleric last year.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of an aide to al-Sadr last week on the same charges
prompted widespread protests by al-Sadr supporters that turned into
heavy gunbattles in the Baghdad neighborhood of Sadr City and outside
Najaf.
