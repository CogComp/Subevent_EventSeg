</P>
<P>
An armed group attacked the home of the Japanese ambassador to Peru
and took over the residence as diplomats and governments officials
attended a party there, witnesses and radio reports said.
</P>
<P>
The attackers apparently set off at least one large explosion and two
minor ones and remained inside the residence Tuesday night. Peru's
Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela, various foreign ambassadors and
Peruvian congressmen also were inside the building.
</P>
<P>
A witness with binoculars looking down on the ambassador's home from a
taller building nearby told Lima radio station Radioprogramas that he
could see armed men crouched behind bushes inside the compound.
</P>
<P>
He also said quests were apparently lying face down nearby.
</P>
<P>
Police surrounded the structure, located in the upscale San Isidro
district of Lima, an area with various foreign embassies.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic gunshots came from inside the residence, and police and news
crews were pinned down around the building.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word on injuries.
</P>
<P>
Congressman Henry Pease, speaking on local radio, said he left the
building shortly after 8 p.m. (0100 GMT) and heard a loud explosion
come from inside.
</P>
<P>
He said there were a considerable number of people at the birthday
party and others were arriving.
</P>
<P>
Pease said guests also included ambassadors from Brazil, Bolivia and
Cuba, as well as Carlos Torres Lara y Lara, president of the Congress.
</P>
<P>
At the scene, Jose Munoz, a security guard with the Venezuelan Embassy
said that country's ambassador was also inside.
</P>
<P>
Peru has two armed rebel movements.
</P>
<P>
The larger group, Shining Path, has been blamed for most of the
political violence in the country over the last 16 years, during which
nearly 30,000 Peruvians have been killed.
</P>
<P>
The violence has subsided since 1992 when Shining Path leader Abimael
Guzman was captured. But rebel attacks continue in parts of the
countryside, especially in the eastern jungle. Last month, Shining
Path guerrillas hacked to death two former rebels who quit fighting
during a governement amnesty program.
</P>
<P>
The other group, Tupac Amaru, has dwindled to a couple hundred armed
followers, according to some estimates, since they began fighting in
1984. But there have been recent reports of reorganization within the
movement.
