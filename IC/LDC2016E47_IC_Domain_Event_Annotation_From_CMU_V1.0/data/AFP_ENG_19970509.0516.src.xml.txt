Unidentified gunmen have shot dead the eldest son of Yemeni Transport
Minister Ahmed Mussaed Hussein in the capital Sanaa, police sources in
Yemen told AFP on Friday.

<P>
The sources said three passers-by were injured in the attack on
Thursday, which they said was not carried out for political motives,
and that the gunmen managed to escape.

<P>
The authorities in Yemen have made no mention of the attack, which
police said could have been linked to a tribal feud in the southern
Chabwa region.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Mohammed Ahmed Hussein, 27, was shot dead in broad
daylight outside his father's house in Sanaa on Thursday afternoon,
and that one of the attackers was injured during a gunbattle with
minister's bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
Hussein was a member of a tribe in the Chabwa region which has been
engaged in a long-running feud with another local tribe, the source
added.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Mussaed Hussein was named transport minister in 1994 after the
civil war sparked by southern leaders who wanted to re-establish a
Marxist republic in the south.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed, a member of the ruling General People's Congress (GPC) of
President Ali Abdallah Saleh, opposed the secession by the south.
