TIKRIT, Iraq (AP)
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi militant group claimed responsibility for the suicide
bombings in Irbil, and a senior U.S. commander blamed recent attacks
on insurgents seeking to sabotage a future independent Iraqi
government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States said it is sticking to its timetable for
Iraq self-rule by July 1 even though U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said Wednesday the deadline might have to be reconsidered to forge an
agreement on a provisional government.
</P>
<P>
The United States says it is impossible to arrange elections in such a
short time because of the ongoing insurgency.
</P>
<P>
In their latest violence, two suicide bombers blew themselves up at
the offices of two Kurdish parties in the northern city of Irbil on
Sunday, killing a total of 109 people.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, an Iraqi insurgent group, the ``Jaish Ansar al-Sunna,''
claimed responsibility for the bombings. It said it targeted the
``dens of the devils'' because of the parties' ties to the United
States. The claim could not be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The two parties are the strongest allies of the United States and had
fought alongside its troops during the invasion of Iraq last March.
</P>
<P>
The statement was posted in Arabic on a Web site that frequently
carries statements by Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
The name of the organization was included among a dozen insurgent
groups that issued a joint statement this week in Ramadi and Fallujah
_  part of the Sunni Triangle stronghold of Saddam Hussein loyalist  _
warning Iraqis against cooperating with the U.S.-led occupation.
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, deputy chief of staff for
operations, said U.S. authorities believe Jaish Ansar is a splinter
group of Ansar al-Islam, an extremist group in northern Iraq with
alleged ties to al-Qaida. He said he believed the Jaish Ansar group
had also taken responsibility for Saturday's car bombing at a Mosul
police station that killed nine Iraqis and injured about 45.
</P>
<P>
The attacks killed numerous officials of the Kurdistan Democratic
Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Insurgents have in recent
weeks widened their operations to include Iraqi civilians in addition
to U.S. forces who have lost 368 troops to hostile fire since the
invasion. The January toll was five more than in December.
</P>
<P>
Despite continuing losses, Maj. Gen. Raymond Odierno, commander of the
Army's 4th Infantry Division based in Tikrit, predicted that coalition
forces would be able to crush the insurgency within a year.
</P>
<P>
He said the violence shows the insurgents are trying to sabotage a
future government or even gain leverage in it.
</P>
<P>
``There are ethnic issues. People are now positioning themselves to
see what their role is in the next government, and they are doing it
by force,'' Odierno said after a tour of Tikrit, Saddam's hometown.
</P>
<P>
``They are trying to disrupt the way things are going so they can get
a little advantage.'' He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority plans to hand over
sovereignty to a provisional Iraqi government on June 30. However,
Iraq's influential Shiite Muslim clergy is demanding that power be
handed over to a directly elected government rather than an
administration chosen indirectly through a system of caucuses, as
envisaged by Washington.
</P>
<P>
L. Paul Bremer, the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, told
reporters in Baghdad Thursday that a United Nations team will land in
Baghdad ``in coming days'' to make recommendations to help end the
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
``The coalition will cooperate in any way the United Nations wants,''
Bremer told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said although the plan to hand over power on June 30 remains
unchanged, the United States is ``prepared to consider refinements or
elaborations'' on a Nov. 15 agreement to hold caucuses.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Wednesday
that if the two sides ``were to change that (Nov. 15) understanding,
that agreement, of course it would be something that we would have to
consider.''
</P>
<P>
In another fatality, a Spanish military adviser, Gonzalo Perez Garcia,
who fell into a coma after being seriously wounded in a shootout last
month died Wednesday, the Spanish Defense Ministry said. He is the
11th Spaniard to be killed here since August.
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops, meanwhile, arrested a relative of Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri,
and believe he may help in the hunt for the most senior former regime
figure still at large, a U.S. officer said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Douri was the vice chairman of the Baath Party's Revolutionary
Command Council and a longtime confidant of Saddam. He is No. 6 on the
wanted list and U.S. forces have offered a US$10 million bounty for
his arrest.   vars/vj
