HEBRON, West Bank (AP)
</P>
<P>
Palestinians burned Israeli flags and hurled firebombs at Israeli
troops on Sunday, and soldiers responded with rubber bullets, wounding
11 Palestinians, four of them journalists.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed the violence that has
occurred in two weeks of daily confrontations on Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
``They are fomenting many of these demonstrations, and they are not
preventing them,'' Netanyahu told a group of Jewish leaders from
Israel Bonds.
</P>
<P>
Three Palestinian cameramen _ APTV's Imad Isseid, Reuters' Mazen Dana
and ABC's Amer Jabari _ were shot and slightly wounded with rubber-
coated metal pellets as they filmed a demonstrator burning Israeli
flags.
</P>
<P>
Diya Juabi, a 23-year-old soundman for Abu Dhabi television, was shot
in the head with a rubber-coated bullet in a later incident but was
not seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Connie Mus, spokesman for the Foreign Press Association, said that
soldiers appeared to be targeting journalists.
</P>
<P>
``It is clearly no coincidence that six of our colleagues were shot
down in recent days,'' Mus said, appealing to Israeli authorities to
use restraint.
</P>
<P>
The army spokesman's office said in a statement that the army was
investigating the shooting of journalists Sunday but that standing
orders barred soldiers from targeting journalists.
</P>
<P>
``The army doesn't shoot at journalists and allows them to do their
work in every way possible,'' said Lt. Col. Sharon Grinker, an army
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said access had been increased recently for journalists in Hebron,
and ``no doubt when journalists are filming inside an area of unrest
they take a chance.''
</P>
<P>
Grinker added that the ``number of those injured does make it
necessary for us to make an internal check.''
</P>
<P>
Isseid, who was wounded in the leg as he filmed the Reuters' cameraman
writhing in pain on the ground, said that he was standing in the
middle of the street far from any demonstrators when he was shot.
</P>
<P>
``We were all journalists. There were no demonstrators, only us
cameramen were around,'' Isseid said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian lawmaker Jamal Shoubaki said that journalists were
targeted as a scare tactic to limit the coverage from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
``They do not want journalists to record the crimes that they are
committing in Hebron,'' Shoubaki said. ``The journalists report to the
world and the world sees the truth that is happening in Hebron.''
</P>
<P>
During the protest, Palestinians wrapped small Israeli flags around
their sandals and stomped on them. One demonstrator then placed all
the flags in a newspaper and lit a match. The fiery bundle was hurled
into the street.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Uzi Dayan, who is in charge of Israeli troops in the West
Bank, warned that Israel would crack down on city residents if the
violence persisted.
</P>
<P>
The radio said Israel would deploy additional undercover units in the
city, would consider closing Palestinian stores and restricting Muslim
prayer at the Tomb of the Patriarchs, a Hebron shrine holy to both
Judaism and Islam.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent attempt to prevent or reduce the extent of the riots
Sunday, Israel used cement blocks to barricade Shalala Street, an
artery separating the Palestinian- and Israeli-controlled sectors of
the city.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlers from the 500-member community in Hebron demonstrated
outside the Prime Ministry in Jerusalem Sunday, demanding that the
government use harsher measures to stop the violence.
</P>
<P>
``We want the government to take care of the security ... the security
of Jews everyday in Hebron,'' said settler spokesman Noam Arnon.
</P>
<P>
There was also sporadic stonethrowing by Palestinian youth at Israeli
troops near the Israeli-controlled shrine Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, Netanyahu convened his Cabinet and discussed the
situation in Hebron for some two hours. Israel TV reported that Ami
Ayalon, head of the Shin Beit security agency, said the Palestinian
Authority was behind the rioting, and Infrastructures Minister Ariel
Sharon called for a new strategy for quelling the violence.
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident in Jerusalem, an Israel bulldozer razed an
Arab-owned home in the city's eastern sector that was built without a
permit.
</P>
<P>
Also, police detained for questioning five right-wing extremists, one
of whom set fire to a Palestinian flag outside the Orient House, the
Palestinian headquarters in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 70 Palestinians held a peaceful protest near the
Jerusalem site where Israel is building Har Homa, a new Jewish
neighborhood whose groundbreaking in March led to the current freeze
in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Cabinet minister Hanan Ashrawi, who participated in the
protest, said ``Har Homa embodies everything (that is) going wrong
with the peace process...The Israelis are trying to undermine not just
our land but the peace process on the whole.''
</P>
<P>
Palestinian children dressed in traditional clothes held up signs that
read ``No peace with the settlements'' and ``No peace with
bulldozers.''
</P>
<P>
The Har Homa site, which Arabs call Jebel Abu Ghneim, is in the
disputed sector of the city where the Palestinians want to establish
their capital. pvs/dp
