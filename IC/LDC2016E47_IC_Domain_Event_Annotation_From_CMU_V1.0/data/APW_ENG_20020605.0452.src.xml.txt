Counterterrorism official points finger at Kuwaiti as mastermind of
Sept. 11 attacks

WASHINGTON (AP)
</P>
<P>
The likely mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks is a Kuwaiti-born
lieutenant of Osama bin Laden who had previously plotted to attack the
World Trade Center and to bomb several airliners simultaneously, a top
U.S. counterterrorism official says.
</P>
<P>
Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, one of the FBI's most-wanted terrorists, is at
large in Afghanistan or nearby, the law enforcement official told The
Associated Press on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. investigators believe Mohammed, working under bin Laden's
leadership, planned many aspects of the Sept. 11 attacks.
</P>
<P>
``There's lots of links that tie him to 9-11,'' the official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``He was intricately involved.''
</P>
<P>
Mohammed is accused of working with Ramzi Yousef in the first bombing
of the World Trade Center, which left six dead in 1993. He and Yousef
also were accused of plotting in 1995 to bomb several trans-Pacific
airliners heading for the United States. Yousef, now serving a life
sentence in the United States after being convicted in the 1993 trade
center bombing, also is believed to have planned to crash a plane into
CIA headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed was charged by federal prosecutors in New York in 1996 in
connection with the alleged 1995 plot. The State Department is
offering a reward of up to dlrs 25 million for information leading to
his capture.
</P>
<P>
Other bin Laden lieutenants are also believed to have helped put
together the Sept. 11 attacks, the official said. But evidence is
mounting that Mohammed was at the center of the operational planning.
</P>
<P>
A second U.S. official, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
acknowledged that Mohammed played a critical role in planning the
attacks but said questions remain about the extent of his leadership.
The official said other bin Laden lieutenants, including Abu Zubaydah,
now in U.S. custody, are also believed to have played top
organizational roles.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed, 36, is one of the highest-ranking al-Qaida leaders still at
large, officials said, and continues to plan attacks against U.S.
interests. Although he was born in Kuwait, officials there say he is a
Pakistani national and note that people born in Kuwait do not
automatically qualify for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
His aliases include Ashraf Refaat Nabith Henin, Khalid Abdul Wadood,
Salem Ali and Fahd Bin Abdallah Bin Khalid.
</P>
<P>
According to the counterterrorism official, within three months of
Sept. 11, the FBI learned that Mohammed had performed some financial
transactions to fund the attacks; since then the United States has
gathered other significant evidence pointing to him as the key
planner. The official declined to go into detail.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden's lieutenants are said to pick targets and attack dates,
maintain operational secrecy and provide money and training to the
foot soldiers and overseas cells chosen to carry them out _ sometimes
at the cost of their own lives.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 19 suicide hijackers are thought not to have known the
entirety of the Sept. 11 plot _ or that they were going to die _ but
Mohammed apparently did, the counterterrorism official said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed has not been charged in connection with the attacks that
killed more than 3,000.
</P>
<P>
He was a close associate of Abu Zubaydah when both were free,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the hijackers trained at Abu Zubaydah's Khalden camp in
Afghanistan, officials said. Generally, though, the hijackers trained
in groups of one or two at several camps, and they were kept apart
from most other trainees.
</P>
<P>
Abu Zubaydah, captured in Pakistan in March, is said to have told U.S.
interrogators that the hijacked plane that crashed in Pennsylvania was
destined for the White House, suggesting he knew of the planning.
</P>
<P>
According to investigators, the Sept. 11 attacks were largely paid for
by Shaikh Saiid al-Sharif, also known as Mustafa Ahmed al-Hisawi, bin
Laden's financial chief. Officials traced a number of financial
transactions between him and several hijackers, but Shaikh Saiid was
not believed to have the wherewithal to plan an operation of Sept.
11's magnitude. He is at large.
</P>
<P>
A fourth bin Laden lieutenant, Tawfiq Attash Khallad, is suspected of
playing a planning role. He met with Sept. 11 hijackers Khalid
Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in January
2000, just before Almihdhar and Alhazmi entered the United States.
Khallad paid for some of the pair's travel, the counterterrorism
official said.
</P>
<P>
Khallad, believed to be a chief planner of the October 2000 USS Cole
bombing in Yemen, remains at large, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Some key connections have yet to be worked out, the official
acknowledged, such as who selected the hijackers to conduct the Sept.
11 operation.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden and his top two deputies, Ayman al-Zawahri and Mohammed
Atef, were believed to have known about the attacks in advance, by
virtue of their station in al-Qaida. Al-Zawahri's family was killed by
a U.S. airstrike in Afghanistan. It is not known where he is.
</P>
<P>
Atef, killed by U.S. airstrikes in November, had a martyrdom video of
other purposed hijackers at his house. Ramzi Binalshibh was a member
of Atta's cell in Germany, but was unable to enter the United States.
He remains at large.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden himself admitted foreknowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks on a
Nov. 9 videotape of him having dinner with a Saudi sheik, al-Zawahri
and some other supporters.
