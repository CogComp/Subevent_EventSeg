At least six injured in Istanbul blast

A separatist group called the  Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK) claimed
responsibility for an  explosion late on Monday which wounded six
people, one of them  seriously, in an Istanbul supermarket.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul governor Muammer Guler told Anatolia news agency the
explosion in the Bahcelievler district of Turkey's largest city
injured six people. The agency said 15 other people had been hurt.
</P>
<P>
"We consider the explosion that took place tonight in an  Istanbul
supermarket to be a response to the barbaric policies  against the
Kurdish people by the fascist Turkish state," the  Falcons said in a
statement published on the website of pro-Kurdish  press agency Firat
(FNA).

<P>
NTV television channel quoted police as saying the attack might  have
been timed to coincide with the anniversary of the arrest on  February
15, 1999, of Kurdish separatist leader Abdullah Ocalan, who  was later
jailed for life.
</P>
<P>
The blast came four days after an explosion rocked an Internet  cafe
in Istanbul frequented by police officers, killing one person  and
injuring 15.
</P>
<P>
Firat, which is based in Europe, reported that an anonymous  caller
had claimed responsibility for that blast on behalf of TAK.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials say TAK is a cover group used by the outlawed
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), of which Ocalan is the leader, to
carry out attacks on civilian targets that would draw international
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
But the PKK denies any link to TAK, which was blamed for a  series of
bomb attacks last year, including one in the Aegean resort  of
Kusadasi in July that killed five people, including two foreign
tourists.
</P>
<P>
The PKK is blacklisted as a "terrorist" organisation by Turkey,  the
United States and the European Union. It has been fighting the  Ankara
government since 1984 in a campaign for self-rule in the  country's
mainly Kurdish southeast. The conflict has claimed some  37,000 lives.
