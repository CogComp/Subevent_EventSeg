Pakistan sets deadline for ex-Guantanamo rebel, captures Uzbek
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pakistan has told a former Guantanamo Bay inmate wanted for the
kidnapping of two Chinese men to surrender by January 15 or face a
military onslaught, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
One-legged Abdullah Mahsud was given the deadline on Monday by a
Pakistani army commander in charge of hunting down Al-Qaeda-linked
militants in the tribal region of South Waziristan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Pakistani security forces captured an Uzbek suspected Al-
Qaeda member in a nearby region on the Afghan border, also on Monday,
while his five Chechen comrades managed to flee.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Pakistani troops are deployed in the area to track down
some 600 Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters, who are believed to have
crossed from Afghanistan after the hardline Islamic regime was ousted
in late 2001.
</P>
<P>
Mahsud, a long-haired, battle-hardened former Taliban fighter, was
behind the October kidnapping of two Chinese engineers, which he used
to press for an end to army operations in the border area.
</P>
<P>
One of the abducted Chinese died in a rescue operation. Mahsud, 29,
has been on the run since and Pakistan recently offered a five-
million-rupee (83,350-dollar) reward for information leading to his
capture.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani commander Lieutenant General Safdar Hussain warned that if
Mahsud and his fellow militant Baitullah did not lay down their arms
before mid-January "stern military action would be taken against
them".
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has already rejected a conditional offer of surrender from
Mahsud.
</P>
<P>
The general told a tribal delegation in Monday to get rid of foreign
militants hiding in South Waziristan, adding: "You should kick them
out of your areas or hand them over to us."
</P>
<P>
The Uzbek Al-Qaeda suspect was captured in neighbouring North
Waziristan after Pakistani troops intercepted a car heading towards
Afghanistan's Khost province, officials in the region's main town
Miran Shah said.
</P>
<P>
One of them, identified as Abdullah, surrendered after an exchange of
fire on Monday night while five others made off under cover of
darkness, local administration official Jamil Khan told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The authorities impounded their vehicle and recovered two assault
rifles, he said.
