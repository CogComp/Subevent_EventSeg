<P>CHATI SINGHPURA, India (AP)</P>
<P>Suspected Islamic separatists roused Sikhs from their homes, lined up 40 men and shot them to death in what India's prime minister called Tuesday an act of ''ethnic cleansing' in Kashmir.</P>
<P>The killings came Monday night as President Clinton was heading to India, and as Sikh residents of Chati Singhpura marked the Hindu ''festival of colors'' by daubing each other with colored pastes to celebrate the harvest.</P>
<P>Some colors were still there Tuesday: red against yellow, as bloodstains smeared a wall, and the white of shrouds of 37 victims laid out in the temple and its garden. Three other men died of their wounds at hospitals.</P>
<P>India said Kashmiri rebels were responsible for the massacre , and accused neighboring Pakistan -- which also claims mainly-Muslim Kashmir -- of supporting the rebels. Both Pakistan and the rebels denied responsibility and condemned the killings .</P>
<P>Clinton, speaking Tuesday in New Delhi at an appearance with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said Monday's attack highlighted ''the tremendous suffering this conflict has caused India.''</P>
<P>''The violence must end,'' Clinton said .</P>
<P>Also Tuesday, at least two Kashmiri rebels stormed an army support camp in the Kashmir capital Srinagar, firing automatic weapons and lobbing grenades as they rushed into the border security base.</P>
<P>Two or three soldiers of the Border Security Force were believed wounded . The rebels, members of a suicide squad, holed up on the ground floor of the base and engaged in a shoot-out with 200 soldiers surrounded the building.</P>
<P>Hours after the massacre in Chati Singhpura, 40 miles south of Srinagar, Indian army troops searched for the gunmen in the hills and apple and almond orchards near the village.</P>
<P>Angry villagers shouted slogans against Pakistan and Vajpayee, and threw stones at reporters' cars.</P>
<P>Home Minister L.K. Advani said Islamic separatists were trying to drive the Sikhs out of Kashmir, just as they had forced out many Hindus with previous attacks .</P>
<P>The attack was the first in the Kashmir conflict to target Sikhs, whose religion combines elements of Hinduism and Islam.</P>
<P>In New Delhi, the prime minister's security adviser, Brijesh Mishra, identified two militant groups suspected in Monday's massacre -- Lashkar-e-Toiba and Hezb-ul Mujahedeen.</P>
<P>''These outfits are supported by the government of Pakistan,'' Mishra asserted .</P>
<P>Pakistan's U.N. ambassador Shamshad Ahmed accused Indian security forces of committing the massacre ''to discredit the legitimate Kashmiri struggle.'' He repeated Pakistan's calls for the United Nations and Clinton to get personally involved to mediate an agreement between India and Pakistan to allow the Kashmiri people to determine their fate.</P>
<P>India rejects outside interference in the conflict, which has been stalemated for more than 50 years and has sparked two wars .</P>
<P>In Srinagar, four leading rebel groups disowned the attack and also blamed it on Indian security agencies.</P>
<P>''We are fighting a holy war and Islam does not allow us to target innocent people,'' Abu Osama, a spokesman for the Lashkar-e-Toiba group was quoted as saying by Press Trust of India. His group did claim responsibility for the attack on the border security base.</P>
<P>Police said the massacre began when gunmen wearing combat uniforms entered Chati Singhpura just after the village celebrated Holi, the festival of color.</P>
<P>''I had taken my dinner and was about to go to bed when my 10-year-old son told me there was some trouble outside,'' said Balbir Singh, a grocery store owner in Chati Singhpura.</P>
<P>He hid , and ''then I heard rapid gunshots . It went on for five to six minutes.'' The attackers killed his younger brother, Deedar Singh. Many Sikh men use the surname Singh.</P>
<P>Gurbachan Singh, a village elder who escaped the massacre because he was looking after his animals at the time, was stunned by the attack .</P>
<P>''I still can't make sense why they did this to us,'' he said .</P>
