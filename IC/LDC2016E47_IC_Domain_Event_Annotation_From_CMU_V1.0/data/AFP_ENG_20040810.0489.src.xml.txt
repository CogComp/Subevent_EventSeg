Kurdish group claims Istanbul attacks (ADDS details, background)
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A previously unknown Kurdish group Tuesday claimed responsibility for
deadly blasts in two Istanbul hotels, following a similar claim by the
Al-Qaeda network, the pro-Kurdish MHA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"A person who called our agency and presented himself (herself) as an
activist from the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons organization claimed
responsibility for the acts in Istanbul which claimed two lives," the
Germany-based agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The person said the attacks were in retaliation for to "recent
operations in Kurdistan and the execution of Kurdish guerrilas,"
adding that details would be revealed later, MHA said.
</P>
<P>
The agency is seen here as a mouthpiece of the former outlawed
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged a bloody 15-year
campaign for self-rule in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey, and groups
related to it.
</P>
<P>
A MHA reporter contacted by AFP said the caller did not specify
whether the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons were linked to the PKK or its
most recent incarnation, the KONGRA-GEL.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time we've heard about this group," she said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu hinted earlier that the
police were looking into a possible Kurdish involvement in the
bombings, in which 11 other people, mostly foreign tourists, were
injured.
</P>
<P>
Two near simultanous attacks targetted two hotels in the heart of
Istanbul early on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They were followed about an hour later with two explosions at a major
gas complex in the outskirts of the city, in which no one was harmed.
</P>
<P>
Aksu said the police had recently cracked down on the PKK, arresting
four alleged members of the group in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The four suspects were thought to have been involved in a July 2 bomb
attack on the convoy of the governor of the eastern Tunceli province,
in which six people were killed and 23 injured, and other violent acts
in the mainly Kurdish southeast, Aksu said.
</P>
<P>
"Our colleagues are looking into all these links," he said.
</P>
<P>
The PKK called off a five-year unilateral ceasefire with the Ankara
government on June 1, warning foreign tourists and investors to stay
away from Turkey.
