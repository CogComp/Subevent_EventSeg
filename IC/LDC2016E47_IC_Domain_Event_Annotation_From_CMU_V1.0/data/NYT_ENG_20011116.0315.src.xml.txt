ATEF WAS DEDICATED TO WAR AGAINST ENEMIES OF ISLAM

</P>
<P>
Mohammed Atef, the top strategist for Osama bin Laden  who was
believed killed in a US bombing this week in Afghanistan, was  the
prototype of an operative for bin Laden's terrorist network.
</P>
<P>
A tall, lanky former Egyptian policeman, he volunteered to fight
Soviet troops in Afghanistan in the 1980s. There, he forged
connections  with bin Laden and his now number two, Ayman al-Zawahri.
With other  so-called Afghan Arabs, he emerged from that conflict a
hardened  veteran, dedicated to a borderless, almost apocalyptic war
against the  perceived enemies of Islam.
</P>
<P>
Under a string of pseudonyms, he went on to organize, recruit, and
plot in Somalia, Sudan, Pakistan, and, in time, Afghanistan again.
</P>
<P>
Over a decade, US and British officials say, Atef emerged as the
mastermind of attacks that came to define a new form of terrorism _
the  destruction of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 and
then the  attacks on New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania of Sept.
11. He is  believed to have organized attacks on American troops in
Somalia in 1993  and was suspected of a hand in the bombing of the USS
Cole off the coast  of Yemen last year.
</P>
<P>
``He was the brains behind the unit,'' said Boaz Ganor, director of
the International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Just last month, Atef warned that US troops would suffer the same
fate in Afghanistan that they did in Somalia, where some of the bodies
of 18 slain soldiers were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Atef's apparent end came in far different circumstances. Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said there were authoritative reports
that  Atef died as a result of US bombing earlier this week south of
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Unlike bin Laden and Zawahri, Atef was a little-known figure. He is
thought to have been born in Egypt in June 1957, his real name Sobhi
Abu  Sitta. He was also known as Abu Hafs or Abu Hafs al-Masri and
used other  aliases _ Sheikh Taysir Abdullah among them, according to
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
Unlike many of the Egyptians who form the backbone of bin Laden's
network, Atef didn't rise through the ranks of Islamic Jihad, the
group  blamed for the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
He  instead created direct links with bin Laden when he left his job
as a  policeman and joined thousands of other Arabs from Egypt,
Algeria, Saudi  Arabia, Yemen, and elsewhere to fight in Afghanistan
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
His lack of a militant past in Egypt proved crucial to Al Qaeda's
success. ``The type of operations credited to him depended on members
who are not well-known to security services in different states,''
said  Mohammed Salah, a leading Arab journalist who has long tracked
Afghan  Arabs.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, Atef had ties with a key bin Laden operative named Ali
al-Rashidi. Like Atef, Rashidi _ also known as Abu Ubaida al-Banshiri
_  was a former Egyptian policeman and Afghan veteran. Together, they
spent  years setting up training camps in Sudan and establishing cells
in East  Africa.
</P>
<P>
Rashidi and Atef also were believed to have played behind-the-scenes
roles in fighting against US troops in Somalia. A British government
document said Atef traveled to Somalia repeatedly in 1992 and 1993,
organizing attacks on US troops who were there to stanch famine. After
each visit, it said, Atef reported back to bin Laden, who was then
residing in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Atef became the military commander for bin Laden's network.
The British government said that among his principal tasks was to
train  new members.
</P>
<P>
Much of what is known about Atef came in the trial that followed the
1998 embassy bombings, which killed 224 people and injured thousands.
Along with bin Laden, he was indicted in those attacks. Evidence
presented during the trial said he coordinated the bombings, keeping
in  touch with the attackers by satellite phone as he moved between
Pakistan  and Afghanistan and met with conspirators in Peshawar.
</P>
<P>
The United States offered $5 million for information leading to his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
Atef was seen repeatedly in the now-famous videos of bin Laden. He
joined the Saudi militant as he declared an International Front for
Fighting Jews and Crusaders in 1998 and was considered, with Zawahri,
to  be among bin Laden's two most trusted aides.
</P>
<P>
Atef was bound to bin Laden by family as well. In January, his  teen-
age daughter married bin Laden's son in the southern Afghan city of
Kandahar.
