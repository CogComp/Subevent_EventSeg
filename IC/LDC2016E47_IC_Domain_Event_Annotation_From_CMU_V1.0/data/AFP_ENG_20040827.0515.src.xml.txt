which has a large Shiite Muslim population, with demonstrators pelting
security personnel with stones, a police spokesman said.

The militia led by firebrand Iraqi cleric Moqtada Sadr surrendered the
Imam Ali mosque, one of Shia Islam's holiest shrines, in Najaf on
Friday after a three-week standoff with US troops.

Meanwhile shops and businesses were closed in the rest of the Kashmir
as lawyers staged a strike in protest at alleged human rights
violations by Indian troops and the re-arrest of prisoners after
courts set them free.
