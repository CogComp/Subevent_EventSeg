</P>
<P>
A car bomb that police said was set by Shining Path guerrillas ripped
off the front of a Lima police station before dawn Thursday, wounding
25 people.
</P>
<P>
The attack marked the return to the spotlight of the feared Maoist
group, recently overshadowed by a smaller rival band of rebels.
</P>
<P>
The pre-dawn bombing destroyed part of the police station and a
municipal office in Lima's industrial suburb of Ate-Vitarte, wounding
8 police officers, one seriously, Interior Minister Cesar Saucedo told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The bomb collapsed the roof of a neighboring hospital, injuring 15,
and blew out windows and doors in a public market, wounding two
guards.
</P>
<P>
People near the blast were cut by shards of flying glass and rescue
workers helped police and civilians, many bleeding from the head and
face, into ambulances. Police said they did not know the total number
injured.
</P>
<P>
Saucedo said guerrillas in one car opened fire on police standing
guard, while a second car carrying 88 pounds (40 kgs) of dynamite
parked in front of the building, and a third car rushed the attackers
away.
</P>
<P>
Pamphlets attributing the attack to the Maoist Shining Path were found
at the scene, he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the bombing may be an attempt by the Shining Path to
reestablish its position as Peru's leading guerrilla group after the
smaller Tupac Amaru rebel group grabbed world headlines when it seized
the Japanese ambassador's residence on Dec. 17.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru rebels held 72 high-profile hostages for 126
days before military commandos rescued 71 of the 72 in a bloody raid
that killed all 14 rebels, one hostage and two commandos.
</P>
<P>
``With the press that the Tupac Amaru rebels won in recent months the
Shining Path felt the need to make their presence felt,'' Shining Path
expert Raul Gonzalez told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected more Shining Path attacks as they try to re-
establish their dominant position.
</P>
<P>
Sweeping up the rubble and broken glass in their stalls, shopkeepers
in the Modelo market across the road from the bombed police station
said it could have been worse. The market was empty when the pre-dawn
bombing occurred.
</P>
<P>
``These terrorists have done so much damage to the country. Now
they're at it again,'' storeowner Teodor Fabio Herrera said.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said the bombing was probably meant to honor the anniversary
of the launching of the Shining Path's insurgency on May 17, 1980,
when guerrillas burned ballot boxes in the highland department of
Ayacucho.
</P>
<P>
The Shining Path usually plans its attacks for the days before or
after a major anniversary to avoid security measures.
</P>
<P>
It was the first car bomb in Lima since July 1996, when one ripped
through a downtown Lima police station, killing one person and
wounding nine.
</P>
<P>
Political violence by the Shining Path has fallen sharply since its
leader and founder, Abimael Guzman, was captured in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Although more than 30,000 people have been killed in political
violence since the Shining Path launched its insurgency in 1980,
rebels killed fewer than 200 people in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Peru's anti-terrorism police say the Shining Path in recent years has
been working in the sprawling shantytowns that ring Lima to rebuild
its grassroots networks and find young recruits who are not known by
intelligence services.
