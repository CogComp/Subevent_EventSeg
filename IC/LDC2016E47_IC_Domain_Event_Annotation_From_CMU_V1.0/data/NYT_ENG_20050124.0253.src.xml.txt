<P>
Security forces in Iraq have captured two senior aides to the most
wanted militant in Iraq, bringing in his top bomb-maker and his
propaganda chief in the past 10 days, an Iraqi government spokesman
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The announcements came hours after a suicide car bomb exploded near
the headquarters of Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's political party,
injuring at least 14 people, nine of them policemen, the Interior
Ministry said. The bomb detonated at a checkpoint guarded by a special
unit of the Iraqi police.

The captured bomb-maker, Sami Muhammad Ali Said al-Jaaf, was seized in
Baghdad on Jan. 15. He is believed to have taken part in three-
quarters of the car bombings in the capital since the war began, the
government spokesman, Thaier al-Naqib, said in a written statement.
Major car bombings here began with an attack on the Jordanian Embassy
in August 2003 and have killed hundreds.
</P>
<P>
Al-Naqib said al-Jaaf also used the name Abu Omar al-Kurdi and is
considered to be a lieutenant of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian
militant who has a $25 million bounty on his head.
</P>
<P>
Al-Jaaf has confessed to making the explosives used in the bombing of
the Jordanian Embassy, which killed at least 11 people, al-Naqib said.
He also confessed to taking part in the car bombing later the same
month in Najaf that killed at least 95 people, including Muhammad Bakr
al-Hakim, a cleric who founded the most prominent Shiite political
party.
</P>
<P>
Al-Naqib issued another statement later on Monday saying that on Jan.
14, security forces captured al-Zarqawi's chief of propaganda, Hasam
Hamad Abdullah Muhsin al-Dulaimi, who is also known as Dr. Hassan. Al-
Dulaimi had not served long in the post; he took the job after
American-led forces killed the former propaganda chief, Hassan
Ibrahim, in a Baghdad raid on Dec. 13, al-Naqib said.
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Hassan has told us that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi designated Abu Omar
al-Kurdi as the lieutenant responsible for attacking election sites
located in Baghdad," he said.
