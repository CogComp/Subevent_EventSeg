SPAIN CONTINUES TO UNCOVER TERRORIST PLOTS, OFFICIALS SAY

MADRID, Spain
</P>
<P>
One year after the worst terrorist attack in Spanish history, the
Spanish police continue to uncover and thwart new plots involving
Islamic militants, according to senior Spanish intelligence and law
enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
Despite sweeping measures to improve their ability to investigate
potential terrorist threats since the March 11, 2004, bomb attacks
that left 191 people dead, the officials estimate that there are
hundreds of people scattered in cells around the country committed to
attacking centers of power in Spain.
</P>
<P>
The police have found indications of a cell of Pakistanis that they
suspect was planning an attack on a high-profile target in Barcelona.
They also found evidence of a cell of North Africans in Madrid that
apparently wanted to attack Madrid's high court, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been lucky that our investigations have managed to abort
other plots before acts of terrorism took place," Juan Fernando Lopez
Aguilar, the justice minister, said in an interview. "That means the
threats have not disappeared."
</P>
<P>
Lopez Aguilar added that Spain had detained about 1,000 people
suspected of being connected to the Madrid bombings and other
potential terrorist activities in the past year. Most have been
released.
</P>
<P>
As for the investigation into the Madrid bombing, it is far from over.
Spain is still hunting down at least half a dozen suspects, who are
probably outside the country.
</P>
<P>
"The great majority of the perpetrators are identified, dead or in
prison," said a senior intelligence official at the Guardia Civil, or
Civil Guard, a police force with military and civilian functions. "But
we cannot say that we have all of them. There are questions that
remain unclear. The most important is: Who masterminded March 11?"
</P>
<P>
Of 79 suspects believed to be involved in the Madrid bombings, 24 are
in jail and awaiting trial. Seven suspects blew themselves up in a
Madrid apartment three weeks after the bombing to avoid capture.
</P>
<P>
The evidence of a Pakistani cell has emerged since the bombings. Last
September, the police arrested 10 Pakistanis suspected of belonging to
a support network for Islamic militants. The raid turned up a video
showing details of a number of buildings in Barcelona, including the
40-story Mapfre Tower and the 44-story Hotel Arts, the two buildings
known as Spain's "twin towers," a senior Spanish intelligence official
said.
</P>
<P>
The police also seized documents and videos calling for an Islamic
holy war, several pounds of cocaine and more than $20,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
The group apparently raised money through drug trafficking, falsifying
documents and extortion, the intelligence officials said. They said
they had evidence that the cell sent the money to cells in Pakistan
that were loyal to al-Qaida. But no evidence of any link to the March
11 attacks was found.
</P>
<P>
The senior intelligence official at the Civil Guard said the group was
sending money to the same Islamic militants who killed the American
journalist Daniel Pearl of The Wall Street Journal in 2002 in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Fernando Reinares, a special adviser to the Interior Ministry and a
terrorism specialist with the Elcano Institute, said, "Apparently they
were taking the first steps of what could be plans for committing
terrorist actions."
</P>
<P>
Another cell was uncovered last fall, when the police carried out an
operation against a group of Algerian and Moroccan radicals who were
believed to be planning an attack on Madrid's High Court and perhaps
other targets.
</P>
<P>
Using informers, investigators learned that the plotters had started
to try to procure explosives for the operation. There was no concrete
information about the exact timing of the attack or the plan for
carrying it out, Spanish officials said. But the government was
concerned that the attack was imminent, so it decided to close down
the cell.
</P>
<P>
Investigators brought the information to Judge Baltasar Garzon,
Spain's highest antiterrorism magistrate, who ordered the arrests of
more than 30 people, mostly North Africans, who were suspected of
taking part in the plot.
</P>
<P>
"This particular plot was pretty close," said Lopez Aguilar, the
justice minister, in an interview. "But it didn't happen."
</P>
<P>
Investigators are trying to piece together whether there are
connections between operatives of al-Qaida in Spain and the Madrid
bombings.
</P>
<P>
Some of those arrested had been in contact with Imad Eddin Barakat
Yarkas, a Syrian who is believed to be the leader of a Qaida cell in
Spain and who is in Spanish custody in connection with the Sept. 11
terror attacks in the United States, a senior intelligence official
said.
</P>
<P>
There were also contacts with Allekem Laamari, an Algerian killed in
the suicide bombing after the Madrid attacks, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Evidence about the cells indicates that Spain is still a target for
terrorist attacks despite the withdrawal of its troops from Iraq. The
Madrid bombers left behind a video declaring that the attacks were an
answer to the Bush administration's "crimes," particularly in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Although Spain has troops in Afghanistan, one of the
first acts by Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero when he was
elected three days after the attacks was to pull troops out of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Spain has taken extraordinary measures to improve
its ability to investigate potential Islamic terrorist plots. Until
March 11, 2004, most of Spain's counterterrorism efforts were focused
on ETA, the Basque separatist movement.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Guard, the police force and the National Intelligence
Center, Spain's external intelligence agency, have been reorganized
under a unified command and meet once a week. The agencies have also
created a joint database of suspects' fingerprints, DNA, voices,
documents, car rentals and travel, as well as details about arms and
explosives transfers.
</P>
<P>
There are also plans to recruit 1,000 more officers and 130 Arab
translators and interpreters.
</P>
<P>
There is no concrete evidence from any foreign intelligence agency of
a phone call or message that suggests that the Madrid plot was
organized from outside Spain.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Dezcallar, the former head of the National Intelligence Center,
the equivalent of the Central Intelligence Agency, was quoted in El
Pais on Thursday as saying that after the attacks he asked the
National Security Agency in Washington to look for evidence of links
with groups outside Spain, but none were found.
</P>
<P>
Spanish intelligence officials said they were not convinced by the
claims of Sayed Ahmed Rabei Osman, known as "Muhammad the Egyptian"
who was arrested in Milan, Italy, last June and extradited to Spain
last December. Although Rabei Osman boasted in conversations recorded
by the Italian police in Milan that he organized the Madrid bombings,
there is no corroborating evidence of his involvement in the attacks,
Spanish officials said.
