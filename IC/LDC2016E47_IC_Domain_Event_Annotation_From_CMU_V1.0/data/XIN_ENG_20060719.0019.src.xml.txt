GAZA, July 19 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Three Palestinian militants were  killed when Israeli troops pushed
into a refugee camp in the  central Gaza Strip on early Wednesday,
Palestinian security  sources and witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops intruded into the eastern part of al-Maghazi  refugee
camp before Wednesday dawn and clashed with militants  there, said the
witnesses, adding that three militants were killed and 15 other people
wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces also took positions in the area, they added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of  the
Palestinian ruling Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), said  in a
statement that its two militants, guarding the eastern  borders of al-
Maghazi, were killed in a gunbattle with Israeli  soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The identity of the third militant shot dead by Israeli forces  was
not immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
Over 90 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier have been killed  since
Israel launched a massive air and ground offensive into the  Gaza
Strip on June 28, three days after the abduction of one  Israeli
soldier by Palestinian militants in a cross-border raid.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army says that the three-week-old operation is  aimed to
rescue the 19-year-old tank gunner Galid Shalit and halt  Palestinian
rocket attacks on Israel.
</P>
<P>
It is the first such Israeli move in the Gaza Strip since  Israel
withdrew forces and settlers from it last summer after 38  years of
occupation.
