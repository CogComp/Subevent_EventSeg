MOGADISHU, January 16 (Xinhua)

<P>
More than 59 people were killed and as many as 130 people were wounded
when a serious fighting broke out recently in Burco, northwest of
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts were between forces loyal to the President of the break
away Republic of Somaliland, Mohamed Ibrahim Egal and those supporting
General Aideed's vice-President Abdurahman Ahmed Ali (Tuur) according
to field radios communicated from Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Opposition sources supporting General Aideed's government said the
attack was one of Egal's provocation in destabilizing the area and was
repulsed back with heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
During the fighting all kinds of weapons including anti- aircraft
missiles, multiple rocket launchers, heavy and small machine guns and
rocket propelled grenades were used. However, both warring sides in
Burco claimed victory, but independent sources indicate that the city,
the second largest in Somaliland, is abandoned and has become no man's
land controlled by freelance looters.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the northwestern region of Somalia, also anticipate that
this new round of fighting might most probably spread to the capital
of Somaliland, Hargeisa, where the clashes between the self styled
government of Egal and those of Abdurahman Tuur had Originated. There
was peace negotiation effort going on in the region. However General
Jama Mohamed Ghalib, the Foreign Secretary of General Aideed and the
spokesman of the opposition groups in Somaliland said no negotiation
would be possible as far as Egal was claiming presidency in
Somaliland.
</P>
<P>
In Burco, no single aid agency or international NGO has been operating
since the beginning of the civil war in Somaliland in early 1995.
Dozens of families are believed to starving in the villages
surrounding Burco after fleeing the fighting with out food, water and
shelter. Somaliland declared its independence from the rest of Somalia
in May 1991.
