PAKISTAN-LINKED GROUPS REPORTEDLY TIED TO BOMBAY BLASTS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>Militant Islamic groups with ties to Pakistan may be behind the bombings that rocked India on Tuesday, and experts warn that if the reports are true, the fragile peace on the subcontinent could be seriously jeopardized.</P>
<P>At stake, they say are the peace talks between India and Pakistan which, up to now, have made steady progress over the status of Kashmir and other issues that have separated the two nuclear-armed powers. </P>
<P>"This dialogue process ... has been incredibly successful," said Dana Dillon, an India expert at the Heritage Foundation in Washington. But if India were to accuse Pakistan of sponsoring the terrorist group that masterminded the attacks, "or somehow trace this terrorist group back to Pakistan it would probably knock the whole chessboard of negotiations over," he said. </P>
<P>Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf was quick to condemn the bombings and no one has yet taken responsibility for the attacks, in which eight separate blasts killed at least 147 people in Bombay and injured hundreds more. </P>
<P>Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called the attacks "shocking and cowardly attempts to spread a feeling of fear and terror among our citizens." He pledged to tackle terrorism with all possible measures. </P>
<P>The Times of India, citing Indian intelligence sources, said two radical Muslim groups were behind the attacks -- one of them based in Pakistan, which has fought two wars with India over Kashmir. </P>
<P>(That group, the newspaper reported, is the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Toiba, or Army of the Pure, which the U.S. government lists as a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda and is thought to include members of the Taliban, according to GlobalSecurity.org, a Washington military think tank)</P>
<P> India blames the group for the bombings in October in crowded New Delhi markets in which 63 people were killed and more than 200 wounded. </P>
<P>The other group, according to the Times of India, is the Indian-based Students Islamic Movement of India, which has been in a loose alliance with Lashkar-e-Toiba. The newspaper said the attack was supposed to "trigger communal conflagration in Bombay, the country's financial capital," which is home to 16 million people. </P>

<P>(In Washington, a U.S. official who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity pointed at another group, Jaish-e-Mohammad, or Army of Mohammed, which is also affiliated with al Qaeda, according to the Bush administration. Targeting trains at rush hour is a tactic Jaish-e-Mohammad favors, the official said.) </P>

<P>The U.S. government has designated Jaish-e-Mohammad a terrorist organization. One of its members, Sheikh Omar Sayed, has been sentenced to death for the murder of U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl in 2001. </P>
<P>"If it is proven, obviously Pakistan has an issue," said Sanjay Puri, chairman of the US-India Political Action Committee, a U.S.-based group that promotes cooperation between New Delhi and Washington. "India will have to continue (exerting) pressure on Pakistan to track down these groups." </P>
<P>The Indian government has not commented yet on who it thinks are the perpetrators or what actions New Delhi may be contemplating. </P>
<P>In 2002, India's accusations that Pakistan was behind the Dec. 13, 2001, attack on India's parliament, which killed more than a dozen people, put the two nations on the brink of a nuclear war. </P>
<P>Since that standoff, the two nations have embarked on a peace process, drawing down the numbers of troops each has along the border and putting a moratorium on nuclear testing. However, India continues to accuse Pakistan of harboring Kashmiri militants, charges that Islamabad denies. </P>
<P>On Tuesday, Musharraf offered condolences to India, saying: "Terrorism is a bane of our times, and it must be condemned, rejected and countered effectively and comprehensively." </P>
<P>Seven carefully coordinated blasts ripped almost simultaneously through packed, rush-hour suburban trains and an eighth detonated at a Bombay train station in the period of just one minute. </P>
<P>The seven train bombs detonated in first-class cars carrying commuters from downtown Bombay to the suburbs between 6 and 6:30 p.m., according to Vilasrao Deshmukh , the top elected official of Maharashtra state, where Bombay is located. During rush hour, each train car can carry 400 to 600 people. </P>
<P>It was not known whether suicide bombers carried out any of the attacks, but Bombay police Inspector Ramesh Sawant said most of the victims suffered head and chest injuries, leading authorities to believe the bombs were placed in overhead luggage racks. </P>
<P>Indian cities went on high alert, quickly setting up checkpoints at train and bus stations, airports and seaports, movie theaters and busy markets. Indian police began carrying out raids across the country immediately after the blasts One TV station said a suspect was in custody. </P>
<P>The home minister, Shivraj Patil, said authorities had had some information that an attack was coming, "but the place and time was not known." </P>
<P>"Every time, you cannot be lucky. Information as to which train they are going to attack and where is not easy to come by," the Times of India quoted a top Indian intelligence official as saying. </P>
<P>The Bombay attacks came hours after several coordinated grenade attacks by Islamist extremists killed eight people in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir, where more than 90 percent of the population is Muslim. </P>

<P>The orchestration of several blasts in quick succession is a tactic frequently employed by Kashmiri groups. </P>

<P>If it turns out that the perpetrators of the Tuesday bombings have a foothold in Kashmir, "India will crack down in Kashmir, where poor Kashmiris have been caught in this devil's triangle of Indian army on one side, Pakistan army on the other side, and Kashmiri rebels," Dillon said. "It will be far worse for them while the Indians crack down trying to track down this terrorist group." </P>
<P>The attacks could also damage the delicate fabric of India's multiethnic society of more than 1 billion people, where centuries-old religious differences between the Hindu majority and the nation's nearly 130 million Muslims have occasionally boiled over into deadly violence, warned Joanne Mariner, a terrorism and counterterrorism program director at Human Rights Watch in New York. </P>
<P>"If these bombings do prove to be linked to militant Islamists, which right now has not been shown, then obviously it's going to exacerbate religious tensions in India," she said. In 2002, after a Muslim mob attacked a train carrying Hindu activists and burned more than 50 alive in the western province of Gujarat, Hindus retaliated, killing nearly 1,000 people, most of them Muslims, in a 72-hour bloodbath. </P>
<P>"These kinds of attacks," like the Tuesday bombing, "create a lot of emotion that could be channeled into something violent," Mariner said. </P>
