ISTANBUL, Turkey
</P>
<P>
A Kurdish militant group on Tuesday claimed responsibility for a
recent bombing at a sidewalk cafe in Istanbul and vowed to further
increase bloodshed in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons warned in the message on their Web site
that "bombs will explode in Turkey, not a single day will pass in
peace."
</P>
<P>
The bombing last Sunday in Bakirkoy injured some 30 people, most of
them hurt by flying glass. No reason was given for why the group
waited more than a week to claim responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons, who go by the Kurdish acronym TAK, have
claimed numerous bombings in Turkey, including attacks that killed
tourists at an Aegean resort last summer. They stated in a recent
posting that the tourism industry was one of their primary targets.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to increase the violence and to obey no rules," the
group said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kurdish militants have been fighting for autonomy mainly in
southeastern Turkey since 1984, though TAK has concentrated its
attacks on the large western cities and tourism centers. The violence
over more than two decades has killed some 37,000 people.
