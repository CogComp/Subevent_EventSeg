<P>
Rebel leaders from Sudan's Darfur region said Saturday that three
people were killed and five injured by government-backed militia, in
an attack they charged was a violation of a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"I want to report a violation of the ceasefire... which happened
(Friday) and was witnessed by the CFC (Ceasefire Commission),"
spokesman for Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) Abdelhafiz Mustafa Musa
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the CFC witnessed the killings at Sayah in Darfur on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Two women were among the dead, he said, accusing the Khartoum-backed
Arab militia known as Janjaweed of the killings.
</P>
<P>
The Janjaweed have been accused of conducting a scorched earth policy
and of ethnic cleansing in Darfur, prompting the UN and rebels groups
to call on the government to rein in the group.
</P>
<P>
According to UN estimates, up to 50,000 people have died in Darfur
since rebels rose up against the government in February last year, and
about 1.4 million people have fled their homes.
