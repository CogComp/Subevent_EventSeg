Top Shiite cleric seen threatened by gunmen who killed Khoei in Najaf
(ADDS denial by accused group)
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Kuwaiti Shiite cleric charged Sunday that gunmen accused of
murdering a prominent cleric in Najaf in central Iraq had now given
the holy city's top religious authority 48 hours to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the accused group, however, denied the charge, which
fueled speculation about mounting rivalry among Shiite factions in the
wake of the downfall of Saddam Hussein's regime.
</P>
<P>
"The group is threatening Imam (Ali) Sistani ... demanding he leave
Iraq within 48 hours," Mohammad Baqer Musawi al-Muhri said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The same ultimatum was given to Sheikh Is'hak Fayyad, an Afghan-born
Shiite religious scholar also based in Najaf, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the group threatening the clerics
comprised followers of Muqtada al-Sadr, 22-year-old son of Mohammad
Sadeq al-Sadr, a senior Shiite authority assassinated in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Muhri, who heads an association of Shiite scholars in Kuwait, has
accused the same group of murdering pro-Western cleric Sayyed Abdul
Majid al-Khoei in Najaf on Thursday, just one week after he returned
to the city from London with the help of US forces who invaded Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A witness to the murder, journalist Maad Fayyad, had told AFP Thursday
that Khoei was stabbed and shot to death by followers of Muqtada al-
Sadr. Two other people were killed in the attack, which took place
inside Imam Ali's tomb, a sacred shrine.
</P>
<P>
Muhri's statement also charged that the group was threatening another
Shiite cleric in Najaf, Sayyed Mohammad Said al-Hakim, with
unspecified punishment unless he pledged allegiance to Muqtada al-
Sadr.
</P>
<P>
Hakim is the nephew of Ayatollah Mohammad Baqer al-Hakim, who heads
the Tehran-based Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq
(SAIRI), the main Shiite Islamist group that opposed the ousted Saddam
regime.
</P>
<P>
It said the gunmen demonstrated outside Sistani's house on Saturday,
shouting "Long Live Sadr" and demanding he leave.
</P>
<P>
"Shiite religious authorities in the (Iranian) holy city of Qom are
very worried about the fate of Imam Sistani ... Hakim ... and Fayyad,"
it said, urging swift intervention by "Muslims, honorable people and
the United Nations" to safeguard their lives.
</P>
<P>
Later Sunday, a spokesman for Sadr denied on Qatar-based Al-Jazeera
television that his group was threatening Sistani.
</P>
<P>
"I categorically deny (the claim) that ... Sadr delivered an ultimatum
to Ayatollah Sistani" to leave Iraq, Riyad al-Nouri told the satellite
channel.
</P>
<P>
The accusations, coming close on the heels of Khoei's assassination,
betrayed inter-Shiite rivalries for religious and political supremacy
in Najaf following the collapse of Saddam's regime.
</P>
<P>
Khoei's return to the city after 12 years had sparked speculation that
the United States was trying to promote a "pro-American" current among
Iraq's majority Shiite community, who were virtually unrepresented
under Saddam.
</P>
<P>
Muhri told AFP he believed "infiltrators from the former Baathist
regime" in Iraq were inciting the Sadr group to attack senior clerics.
</P>
<P>
The murder of Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr in 1999 was generally blamed on
the Baghdad regime, although some linked it to inter-Shiite rivalries
over religious authority.
</P>
<P>
The current tensions could also be a harbinger of renewed competition
between post-Saddam Najaf and Iran's Qom, the other seat of Shiite
religious learning.
</P>
<P>
A leading Shiite cleric in Lebanon, Sayyed Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah,
meanwhile ordered Iraqi Muslims to support Sistani "by all means,"
adding that his appeal amounted to a fatwa, or religious edict.
