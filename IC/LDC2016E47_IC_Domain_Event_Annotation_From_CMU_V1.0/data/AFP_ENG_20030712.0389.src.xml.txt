Attack hints resurgence of Shining Path rebels in Peru by Ricardo

<P>
A resurgence of violence by Shining Path rebels in Peru this week
raised questions on whether the Maoist group, thought to have been
nearly eradicated, is staging a comeback.
</P>
<P>
Shining Path fighters ambushed an army patrol Thursday, killing five
soldiers and two civilians and wounding several others, the group's
bloodiest attack on the army since the killing of five soldiers in a
1999 helicopter ambush.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are doubly concerned because Thursday's attack was on a
patrol sent out specifically to root out what were thought to be
remnants of the Shining Path.
</P>
<P>
It occurred in village of Matucana in Ayacucho province, 500
kilometers (310 miles) south of Lima.
</P>
<P>
The dead included four officers and one enlisted man. The two
civilians were part of a local self-defense force acting as guides for
the patrol, tracking a column of some 50 Shining Path guerrillas who
had been recruiting in a nearby village earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the attack, Vice President Raul Diez Canseco, during
a visit to Chile, acknowledged an apparent resurgence of Shining Path
activity in his country, but stressed Peru remained safe.
</P>
<P>
He sought to downplay the incident, calling it the work of an isolated
group of guerrillas, which former president Alberto Fujimori attempted
to crushed.
</P>
<P>
Cancseco claimed the Shining Path activities were limited to a rural
area in the southeast of the country that is difficult to access.
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Peruvian anti-terrorist police announced the capture of
what was believed to be the last Shining Path leader still at large.
</P>
<P>
Florentino Cerron Cardoso was captured July 5 in the city of Huancayo,
in the Andes of central Peru, after a lengthy intelligence operation,
said General Marco Miyashiro, chief of Peru's anti-terrorism police
force.
</P>
<P>
Cerron Cardoso was a member of the Shining Path's central organizing
committee and had attended its first congress in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The October 1999 attack, which claimed the lives of five soldiers, was
a fiasco that signaled the demise of the Fujimori strategy of
isolation and decapitation.
</P>
<P>
The victims comprised a delegation of high-level army officers,
arriving in the heart of Shining Path territory in a military
helicopter after weeks of secret talks on the surrender of a Shining
Path leader still at large.
</P>
<P>
The officers were part of the government's anti-insurrection strategy
team.
</P>
<P>
The instant their helicopter set down and its occupants were
descending, guerrillas opened fire in what turned out to be a decisive
and humiliating massacre.
</P>
<P>
The bodies were recovered months later, mutilated and dismembered, in
what was broadly seen as the death knell for Fujimori's campaign to
eradicate the Maoists on their own turf.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's ambush was seen as worse still, including the deaths of two
members of the government-armed and -organized civilian self-defense
forces formed in the past decade as the spearhead of the anti-
subversion battle.
</P>
<P>
The government's organization and arming of Indian communities in the
early 1990s to counter the Shining Path guerrillas, who never
hesitated to execute anyone they considered opposed to their movement,
was seen at best as a long shot.
</P>
<P>
The government, said observers, was gambling big that these Indians
would remain faithful, would not side with the Maoists, and would not
turn their government-issued weapons against the government.
</P>
<P>
The gamble, experts say, paid off, allowing the government to isolate
and put the screws to the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
"The self-defense committees drained the pond in which the Shining
Path thought they could swim freely, a military strategy based on the
Maoist precept that a revolutionary needs to be immersed in his
population like a fish in water," explained one expert.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's ambush came only two days after Peruvian President
Alejandro Toledo had launched an anti-subversion operation in the
heart of the Shining Path's stronghold, an Amazonian jungle in the
foothills of the Andes mountains.
</P>
<P>
The Shining Path guerrillas seized the initiative last June 9,
kidnapping, in the space of 36 hours, 71 people working on a gas
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas have since escalated their attacks, including a June 25
ambush that left one soldier dead and three wounded.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this week more than a thousand government
troops have been deployed to the area.
