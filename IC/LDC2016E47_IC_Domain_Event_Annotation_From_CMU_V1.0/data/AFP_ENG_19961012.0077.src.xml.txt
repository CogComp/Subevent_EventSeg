Taliban claim victory over Masood supporters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taliban militia Saturday claimed victory over guerrillas loyal to
the ousted Afghan government, saying it had regained control of areas
north of Kabul and killed and wounded scores of rebels.
</P>
<P>
"The situation has changed drastically in our favour over the last two
days," acting Information and Culture Minister Amir Khan Mutaqi told
AFP.
</P>
<P>
The victory claim came despite evidence that the fighting north of
Kabul was moving nearer to the capital.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the Taliban religious militia and armed supporters of
the ousted Kabul government forced closure of the main road 20
kilometres (12 miles) north of Kabul Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The road is closed. We have a clean-up operation to clear the area of
Masood fighters," a Taliban commander told AFP, referring to Ahmad
Shah Masood, military strongman of the former government.
</P>
<P>
The closure indicated that the fighting had crept closer to the Afghan
capital captured by the Islamic militia on September 27. On Friday,
the fighting was about 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the capital.
</P>
<P>
The former regime's top military commander Ahmad Shah Masood on
Wednesday began launching a series of commando-style attacks on the
Taliban in their newly captured territory north of Kabul, sending the
panicked militiamen scurrying to defend themselves, observers said.
</P>
<P>
Radio Kabul echoed Muttaqi's claim that the Taliban were again fully
in control of Kabul and its surroundings, saying that Masood's men had
suffered serious casualties in their clashes with the religious
militia.
</P>
<P>
"Units of the Islamic Afghan army are forging ahead on all fronts and
have made the enemy retreat and have inflicted heavy casualties on
them," the Taliban-run state radio station said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Taliban forces had Friday launched an operation to
"clean up the forces of evil and corruption" in the areas north of
here.
</P>
<P>
Taliban fighters fired rockets Saturday at the village of Shakar
Darra, once a stronghold of mujahedeen loyal to Masood, the former
Afghan defence minister and main military backer of ousted President
Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban themselves were not clear if they were fighting Masood
infiltrators from outside the area or pro-Masood supporters who were
local residents. But they described one bound prisoner as a "Masood
combat commander."
</P>
<P>
"We don't know how many of Masood's people are there but we expect to
clear the area by tomorrow or the day after," the Taliban commander
noted.
