GAZA, July 9 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
One Palestinian was killed and at  least four others were wounded in
an Israeli air raid near the  southern Gaza town of Rafah on Sunday,
Palestinian security  sources said.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli military plane fired a missile at a car carrying  five
members of Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, which is an armed  wing of
Hamas, in the village of Shuka near Rafah, said the  sources.
</P>
<P>
The militants managed to jump out of the car and escaped the  attack,
but the Israeli plane then fired a second missile at the  militants,
said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Reports conflicted concerning the identities of the casualties.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security sources said that one Palestinian  bystander was
killed and at least four others were injured.
</P>
<P>
But witnesses said that the killed Palestinian was one of the  five
Hamas militants targeted by the Israeli airstrike, adding  that the
four other militants were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian medics said that one of the injured was in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army confirmed the airstrike, which it said  targeted
Palestinian militants.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops continued a massive ground and air offensive in  the
Gaza Strip on Sunday in a bid to free an Israeli soldier  kidnapped by
Palestinian militants on June 25 and prevent  Palestinian militants
from firing rockets onto Israel.
</P>
<P>
Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades took part in the June 25 cross- border
raid on an Israeli army post, during which two other  Israeli soldiers
were killed and the 19-year-old Corporal Gilad  Shalit was kidnapped.
