<P>
Three Saudi nationals suspected of planning suicide attacks against
U.S. and British warships were arraigned in a Moroccan court on
Monday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The suspects, identified as Hilal Jaber Aouad Alassiri, Zuher Hilal
Mohamed Al Tbabti and Abdellah M'Sefer Ali Al Ghamdi, were charged
with ``breach of internal and external state security.''
</P>
<P>
The charge carries the death penalty, but Morocco rarely carries out
capital punishment. The last person to be executed after being
convicted of a capital crime was in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The three men are Saudi citizens between the ages of 25 and 35 and
claim to be members of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida terrorist network.
</P>
<P>
The suspects will be tried in a Moroccan court, officials here said,
excluding for now the possibility that they would be either extradited
to Saudi Arabia or handed over to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States is holding detainees suspected of links to the
fallen Taliban regime of Afghanistan or al-Qaida at the U.S. naval
base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Three women, including two wives of the suspects, have been summoned
to appear before a criminal court on related charges.
</P>
<P>
The men, who allegedly were planning attacks against U.S. and British
warships in the Strait of Gibraltar, were arrested in May.
</P>
<P>
Moroccan authorities said the suspects planned to sail a dinghy loaded
with explosives from Morocco into the strait to attack the vessels.
</P>
<P>
The plan was similar to one carried out in October 2000, when two
suicide bombers in a small dinghy rammed the USS Cole destroyer in a
port in Yemen, killing 17 sailors.
</P>
<P>
The United States blames bin Laden's network for the Cole attack and
the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
