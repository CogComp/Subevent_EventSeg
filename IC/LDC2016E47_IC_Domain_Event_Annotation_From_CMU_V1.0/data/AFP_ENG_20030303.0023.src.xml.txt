Information from Al-Qaeda operative key in capture of Mohammed: report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Intelligence officials were able to track down alleged terror
mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed in Pakistan with leads gotten from a
key al-Qaeda lieutenant, the Washington Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Interrogations of Mohammed's cohort Ramzi Binalshibh have pierced some
of the secrecy surrounding al-Qaeda, it said, and given international
intelligence officials valuable leads as they work to track down key
members of the group.
</P>
<P>
The capture of Binalshibh, a former roomate of September 11 suicide
pilot Mohamed Atta, "provided incredible intelligence and human
sources on al-Qaeda and its operations to the Americans," one
intelligence official told the daily.
</P>
<P>
"Ramzi showed the way to Khalid Sheik Mohammed, and Mohammed may lead
the Americans to Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri," bin Laden's
top aide, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Binalshibh is said to be the planner of several attacks on US and
other Western targets inside Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He was apprehended in Pakistan on the first anniversary of the
September 11 attacks and Pakistani officials said his capture, like
that of Mohammed, was made possible by an earlier raid.
</P>
<P>
"Abu Zubaida's arrest led to Ramzi's capture," the official told the
Post, referring to the apprehension of al Qaeda's top recruiter in
Faisalabad, Pakistan, in March 2002.
</P>
<P>
Binalshibh was handed over to US authorities by Pakistan's Inter-
Services Intelligence agency within a few hours of his capture and
interrogated at an undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Mohammed, considered a key planner of the September 11
attacks, is considered a major breakthrough in the hunt for al-Qaeda
fugitives.
</P>
<P>
He is currently in the custody of US authorities, at a location
outside the United States, according to intelligence officials.
