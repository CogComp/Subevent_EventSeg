Pakistan army helicopters attack militant hideouts in tribal region
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Pakistani helicopter gunships on Wednesday attacked suspected hideouts
of Al-Qaeda-linked militants in a remote tribal region near the Afghan
border, a day after an ambush killed several soldiers, residents said.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the gunships targeted hideouts in Spinkai Raghzai. The
town is a stronghold of tribal militant commander Abdullah Mahsud, the
man behind the recent kidnapping of two Chinese engineers.
</P>
<P>
"I saw two helicopters firing into the town early this morning but I
am not aware of any casualties," resident Dost Mohammad told AFP by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
No immediate confirmation of the raid was available from military
officials.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday militants believed to be Mahsud loyalists attacked an army
convoy, kiliong five soldiers and wounding seven.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports put the toll at three soldiers dead and five injured.
</P>
<P>
Mahsud, a former prisoner at Guantanamo Bay, is being hunted for the
abduction of two Chinese engineers, which ended last Thursday when
commandos killed five kidnappers and rescued one Chinese. The other
Chinese died of bullet wounds suffered during the rescue.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has said the kidnap mastermind
would be brought to justice and severely punished.
</P>
<P>
The military has launched several previous operations in the wild
South Waziristan region against hundreds of militants, including
foreigners, who are believed to be hiding there with local help.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the head of operations for the tribal territory gave a new
casualty count.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant General Safadr Hussain said 246 militants including 100
foreigners had been killed along with 171 soldiers since March.
</P>
<P>
Mahsud became commander of Al-Qaeda-linked militants after the
military killed his predecessor Nek Mohammad in a missile strike in
June on his hideout near Wana, the main town in the district.
</P>
<P>
Mahsud returned to his rugged homeland after he was released in March
from the US Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan authorities have said he was not on the list of Pakistanis
released from the center and might have returnned via Afghanistan. He
was captured there in late 2001 after the US-led invasion ousted the
Taliban regime.
