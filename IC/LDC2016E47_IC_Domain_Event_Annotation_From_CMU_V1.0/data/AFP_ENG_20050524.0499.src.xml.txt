Two Moroccan suspects in Madrid train bombings freed on bail
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spanish authorities have freed on bail  two Moroccans held since
February on suspicion of involvement in  last year's March 11 train
bombings in Madrid, judicial officials  said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rachid Bendouda and Rachid Mohamed Kadour, suspected of  collaboration
with a terrorist organisation, were freed on May 10  and 11
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Judge Juan del Olmo jailed Bendouda on February 9 after saying  he
believed he had a "close" relationship with Jamal Zougam, one of  the
presumed bombers and now in custody facing charges.
</P>
<P>
According to Del Olmo, Bendouda also has links to Imad Eddin  Barakat
Yarkas, alias "Abou Dahdah", currently on trial along with  23 other
suspected Al-Qaeda operatives, three of whom are suspected  of having
helped prepare the September 11, 2001 attacks in the  United States.
</P>
<P>
Abou Dahdah is suspected of having headed up a Spanish-based  Al-Qaeda
cell which Spanish investigators dismantled in the  aftermath of the
September 11 attacks.
</P>
<P>
Bendouda is also suspected of having met Abdennabi Kounjaa,  alias
"Abdallah", the night before the bombings of four commuter  trains
which killed 191 people in Spain's worst such attack.
</P>
<P>
Kounjaa, suspected of directly participating in the bombings,  blew
himself up along with six associates during a police raid on a  flat
in a Madrid suburb three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
In total, 23 people, the majority Moroccans, remain in custody  over
the Madrid blasts and 104 others are suspected of having been
implicated in the carnage.
</P>
<P>
None has yet been formally charged, although a Spanish teenager  was
last year sentenced to six years in custody for helping to  transport
the explosives used.
