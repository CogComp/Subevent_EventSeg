Masood dynamites entance to Panjshir by Terence White

<P>
Afghan troops forced out of Kabul dynamited the entrance to the key
Panjshir Valley on Tuesday to halt the rapidly advancing Taliban
fundamentalist militia.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to put up a very strong defence, and God willing deny
the Taliban entry to the Panjshir," said Bismillah Khan, a commander
loyal to Ahmad Shah Masood, one of the key defenders of the previous
Kabul regime.
</P>
<P>
The Panjshir Valley, some 100 kilometres (60 miles) north of Kabul, is
now the frontline of troops loyal to Burhanuddin Rabbani, whose Kabul
government was routed by the Taliban last Friday.
</P>
<P>
But in the Salang Pass, west of the Panjshir, there was no fighting
reported between the Taliban and the army of ex-communist general
Abdul Rashid Dostam. The Taliban deputy foreign minister held a press
conference Tuesday to deny that his group had given a 24 hour deadline
to Dostam to give in.
</P>
<P>
Bismillah Khan and his men were seen burying massive quantities of
explosives to blow up the single lane dirt road running alongside the
river.
</P>
<P>
There is now no access to the Panjshir Valley by car from the nearby
town of Gulbahar, which is occupied by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Scores of families were seen leaving the Panjshir on foot Tuesday
before soldiers blew up the road.
</P>
<P>
Two smaller explosions on Monday denied Taliban tanks access to the
Panjsher, but civilians were able to get through.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the Taliban captured the provincial capital of Charikar on
Sunday they pushed north to Jabal us-Saraj and Gulbahar. At least
three Taliban infantry attempts to get into the Panjsher from Gulbahar
were repulsed, Bismillah Khan said.
</P>
<P>
"We have put men on top of all the mountains here. This is our native
country and you can expect that we know how to deal with our enemies
who tresspass," said Bismillah Khan.
</P>
<P>
Masood, who travellers reported seeing in the Panjshir town of Bozarak
Monday, has massive stockpiles of heavy weapons and ammunition, but
observers have raised doubts about the morale of his men to stand
firm.
</P>
<P>
Bismillah Khan used to be commander of Bagram airbase to the south,
from where Masood saved jets, transport planes and helicopters before
it was captured by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
East of the neighbouring provincial capital of Kunduz, is Takhar
province where the ousted government of Rabbani and ex-prime minister
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar is reportedly based in the capital Taloqan.
