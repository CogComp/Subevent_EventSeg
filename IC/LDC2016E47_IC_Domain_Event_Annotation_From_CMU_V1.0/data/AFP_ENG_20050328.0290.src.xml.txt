Followers of slain Yemen rebel preacher kill seven policemen by

Seven Yemeni police were shot dead  Monday by followers of a rebel
preacher killed last year by the  army, in an attack on their patrol
in Saada province of northwest  Yemen, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
The policemen were killed by followers of Sheikh Hussein Badr  Eddin
al-Huthi, of the Faithful Youth organization, who attacked  their
patrol at dawn in Nushur, northeast of the town of Saada, the
official told AFP, requesting anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Police and army units launched an offensive against the  militants
following the attack, but it was not immediately known if  any of
Huthi's followers were killed in the assault, in which heavy  weapons
were used.
</P>
<P>
The renewed violence came less than 10 days after Yemeni police  shot
dead three Huthi supporters during a clash in Saada.
</P>
<P>
Three prominent Faithful Youth members were killed and two  others
wounded on March 19 "when police attacked them as they tried  to buy
weapons and ammunition from a store," a local official told  AFP at
the time.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said three policemen were injured in that clash, the  first
since the Yemeni government announced in September last year  that the
army had killed the radical Zaidi preacher, nearly three  months after
he started a rebellion in the mountainous northwest.
</P>
<P>
The uprising, near the border with Saudi Arabia, triggered  clashes
which left more than 400 people dead.
</P>
<P>
The Zaidi sect is a moderate Shiite Muslim sect dominant in  northwest
Yemen but in the minority in the mainly Sunni country.
</P>
<P>
The local official said after the March 19 incident that  security
forces had been hunting down members of the Faithful Youth
organization, an offshoot of the Islamist opposition movement Al-Haq
formed in 1992, after hundreds of detained Huthi followers "refused
to drop their radical religious views".
</P>
<P>
"Security authorities in Saada detected underground movements by  the
remnants of the Faithful Youth organization in the past few days  in
the Nushur area... and in Saqin, near the Maran mountains" where  last
year's rebellion took place, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Authorities had offered a 10-million-rial (55,000-dollar) reward  for
information leading to the capture of Huthi, whom they accused  of
seeking to foment sectarian strife.
</P>
<P>
But Huthi told AFP last July the conflict was a result of his  anti-US
stand.
</P>
<P>
Huthi's top aide, Abdullah Ayedh al-Razami, was reported by  officials
to have surrendered to authorities along with dozens of  supporters 10
days after the announcement of his death.
</P>
<P>
They turned themselves in in Saada, where they had been besieged  by
army troops for more than two months.
