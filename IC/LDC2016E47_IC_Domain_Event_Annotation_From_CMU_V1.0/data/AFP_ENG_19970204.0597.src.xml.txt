Lebanese Shiites rejoice at 'Night of Destiny' helicopter crash
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lebanese Shiites living in areas controlled by Hezbollah guerrillas
fired shots into the air to rejoice at Tuesday's mid-air crash between
two Israeli helicopters which killed more than 70 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
News of the accident, the worst catastrophe in Israeli military
history, was announced by muezzins from mosques across villages in
south Lebanon near Israel's self-declared "security zone."
</P>
<P>
"God has responded to the wish of Moslems because it is the Night of
Destiny," said one muezzin, referring to a Moslem celebration marking
the day God handed the Koran, the Islamic holy book, to the prophet
Mohammad.
</P>
<P>
"We asked that they throw themselves against each other and that the
winds destroy their planes, and God has heard us," the caller to
Moslem prayers said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced an
investigation into the accident, in which two Sikorsky troop carriers
collided over northern Israel as they were flying to the occupied zone
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian Shiite movement, is spearheading a guerrilla
campaign against the Jewish states's occupation of the region.
</P>
<P>
In the town of Baalbek, a Hezbollah stronghold in eastern Lebanon,
news of the crash was greeted by automatic weapon fire which lasted
around half an hour. In some villages, sweets were distributed as a
sign of joy.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah television Al-Manar was the first to announce the accident
in Lebanon and was inundated with telephone calls from viewers
offering their congratulations.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Israeli artillery bombarded south Lebanon with more
than 100 shells, damaging several houses, in retaliation for a
Hezbollah attack on Israeli positions.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Bweiz said he will complain about the
Israeli shelling to an international committee monitoring a ceasefire
accord in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord which ended Israel's "Grapes of Wrath" offensive in
Lebanon last year, in which 175 people were killed, civilians on both
sides must be spared any attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, four Israeli soldiers have been
killed and 15 wounded in attacks in south Lebanon, most of them
carried out by Hezbollah.
