CAR EXPLOSION IN GAZA CITY KILLS A LEADER OF JIHAD GROUP

<P>
A leader in the armed wing of the Palestinian faction Islamic Jihad
was killed Wednesday when an explosion tore a car apart on a busy
street in Gaza City.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the blast was not clear. Islamic Jihad, which carried out
all six suicide bombings in Israel last year, blamed Israel for the
death of the man, Khaled Dahdouh, who had survived many attempts to
kill him. Khaled al-Batsh, another Islamic Jihad leader, said the
blast had been caused by an Israeli airstrike, or by a bomb detonated
by remote control, Agence France-Presse reported.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military, which regularly acknowledges killing Palestinian
militants, said it had nothing to do with the blast, which left a
white sedan scorched and mangled.
</P>
<P>
Violence also erupted in the West Bank, where Palestinian gunmen
staged two shootings, killing one Israeli man, Eldad Abir, 48, at a
gas station, and seriously wounding a second man, the Israeli military
said. Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades claimed responsibility for both
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Islamic Jihad rejected an informal truce that other armed Palestinian
factions agreed to a year ago. In addition to its suicide bombings,
the group has fired rockets from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel.
Islamic Jihad members have frequently been the targets of Israeli
attacks in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been carrying out ground raids in the West Bank and
occasional airstrikes in Gaza, saying it is responding to planned or
actual Palestinian attacks. The vast majority of the deaths in recent
weeks have been on the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
In February, 33 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli security
forces, and one Israeli civilian was stabbed to death by a
Palestinian, the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group said in its
monthly report on fatalities.
</P>
<P>
Israel's foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, began a European tour on
Wednesday by calling on European countries not to finance a
Palestinian Authority government led by the militant group Hamas.
</P>
<P>
"Part of the idea of the free world fighting terrorism is not to
welcome terrorists, not to give money to terror," Livni said in
Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
Israel has already stopped transferring the tax money it collects on
behalf of the Palestinians. The European Union agreed Monday to
provide more than $140 million in emergency assistance to the
Palestinians, who have a caretaker government. The European Union did
not say what it would do when Hamas comes to power, which is expected
this month.
</P>
<P>
The leader of Israel's left-leaning Labor Party, Amir Peretz, plans to
meet Thursday in the West Bank with the Palestinian Authority
president, Mahmoud Abbas.
</P>
<P>
Meetings between Israeli politicians and Abbas have been rare since he
was elected a year ago, and it is even more unusual for such talks to
occur in Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
Peretz, who was born in Morocco, recently went to Egypt for talks with
President Hosni Mubarak, and to Morocco for a visit with King Mohammed
VI.
</P>
<P>
Israel has national elections planned for March 28, and the Labor
Party is running a distant second to the centrist Kadima Party, led by
the acting prime minister, Ehud Olmert.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party has long advocated peace talks with the Palestinians,
though the party says it would not negotiate with Hamas, which has
always refused to recognize Israel.
