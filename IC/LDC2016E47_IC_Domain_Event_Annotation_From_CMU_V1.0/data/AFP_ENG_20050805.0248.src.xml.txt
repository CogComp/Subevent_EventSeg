Bus shooting exacerbates tensions over Gaza pullout by Patrick Anidjar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The murder of four Arab Israelis by a  Jewish extremist has raised
tensions over the Gaza withdrawal to a  whole new level amid fears
that radicals are plotting further  attacks in a bid to torpedo the
operation.
</P>
<P>
Until Thursday evening, the opposition to Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon's disengagement plan, which will see Israel leave the Gaza
Strip after a 38-year occupation from August 17, had been largely
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
Although there had been a number of clashes between the security
forces and ultranationalists inside Gaza several weeks ago, the
campaign against the pullout has been characterised by mass protests
and largely abortive attempts by settlers to infiltrate the main  Gush
Katif settlement bloc.
</P>
<P>
By emptying his rifle on a bus in the northern Galilee, Nathan  Zada
awoke memories of some of the most traumatic chapters in the  recent
history of the Middle East including the assassination of  Yitzhak
Rabin and the massacre of 29 Muslim worshippers in Hebron,  both
perpetrated by Jewish extremists.
</P>
<P>
Shocking as the shooting was, it was also not unexpected.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence sources have long feared that radicals could try to
carry out a spectacular attack that would inflame the situation to
such an extent that the government would have to abandon
disengagement.
</P>
<P>
Indeed after Rabin's assassination in 1995, the centre-left  Labour
party soon found itself turfed out of government with the  hardline
Benjamin Netanyahu taking over the premiership.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that while the number of opponents of  disengagement
willing to do anything to stop its implementation is a  tiny minority,
they could still number in the hundreds.
</P>
<P>
"The murder in Shfaram is an individual event. But Zada is a
phenomenon," said Alex Fishman, the top-selling Yediot Aharonot
daily's security affairs analyst.
</P>
<P>
"There are dozens, perhaps hundreds, like him. And in the period  of
violent incitement on the eve of the disengagement, more such
potential murderers crop up.
</P>
<P>
"Most of them will not murder Arabs tomorrow just for being  Arabs,
but each such Zada has a short fuse, and nobody knows what  will light
it. Such people have no inhibitions. They are into the  'self-
sacrifice' thing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharon himself appears to be taking no chances, as he now  reportedly
sleeps with a pistol under his pillow in case an assassin  tries to
pick him off at night.
</P>
<P>
According to General Iftah Ron, the head of Israeli ground  forces,
there is every chance of a "repetition" of Zada's attack.
</P>
<P>
"The Tsahal (Israeli army) cannot allow such a criminal to use  his
uniform and his weapon to kill innocent civilians," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zada was able to carry out his attack despite warnings from even  his
own mother that he could be a potential danger. "We begged them  to
take away his gun," Debbie Zada said.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the launch of an investigation into the killing, the  army
acknowledged that Zada was of "a problematic background". He  had
recently moved to one of the most extreme settlements in the  northern
West Bank and was a member of the banned ultranationalist  Kach
movement.
</P>
<P>
For Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas, the killing highlighted
negligence on the behalf of the Israeli authorities who allow
settlers to carry weapons. The Hebron outrage in 1994 was carried  out
by a radical settler, Baruch Goldstein, living in nearby Kiryat  Arba.
</P>
<P>
"This crime is a clear illustration of the danger posed by  Jewish
settlers to our people and we want to know why the Israeli  government
allows them to be armed and commit crime after crime,"  Abbas said in
a statement.
