<P>
While Turkish troops have been fighting a Kurdish faction in northern Iraq, two other Kurdish groups have been battling each other.
</P>
<P>
A radio station operated by the Kurdistan Democratic Party said the party's forces attacked positions of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan on Monday in the Kurdish region's capital Irbil.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of Iraqi Kurdistan radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp., said more than 80 Patriotic Union fighters were killed and at least 150 wounded .
</P>
<P>
The fighting was also reported by a senior Patriotic Union official, Kusret Rasul Ali, who said PUK forces repelled a large KDP attack .
</P>
<P>
``They left dozens of corpses at the battlefield,'' he told Radio Monte Carlo, which broadcasts to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Ali claimed that 300 KDP fighters were killed or wounded and only 11 Patriotic Union members died.
</P>
<P>
In January, Patriotic Union forces took control of Irbil, about 320 kilometers (200 miles) north of Baghdad, after months of internecine clashes in the Kurdish ``safe haven.''
</P>
<P>
The enclave was set up by the Western allies after the 1991 Gulf War to protect the Kurds from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
About 35,000 Turkish troops, backed by warplanes and tanks, have entered the enclave to wipe out bases of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which is fighting for independence in eastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The leftist Patriotic Union has accused the conservative Democratic Party of collaborating with Turkish troops.
