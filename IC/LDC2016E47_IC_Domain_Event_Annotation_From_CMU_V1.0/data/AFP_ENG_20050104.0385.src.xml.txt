The Al-Qaeda linked Army of Ansar al-Sunna  claimed responsibility
Tuesday for a car bomb attack which killed  for Iraqi guardsmen north
of Baghdad Monday, in a statement posted  on its website.
</P>
<P>
"One of the heroes of Islam... carried out a martyrdom operation
against a large number of national guardsmen in Balad, blowing them
apart," said the statement, whose authenticity could not be
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
A US military spokesperson said the car bomb exploded near a  national
guard checkpoint outside a US military base in Balad, 70  kilometers
(45 miles) from the Iraqi capital, killing four national  guards and
wounding 14.
</P>
<P>
Ansar al-Sunna had claimed responsibility for another suicide  blast
Monday which killed four people and wounded 24 near the  Baghdad
headquarters of the Iraqi National Accord party of interim  Prime
Minister Iyad Allawi. Two of the dead and 18 of the wounded  were
Iraqi policemen.
</P>
<P>
Ansar al-Sunna split from another radical group, called Ansar  al-
Islam, both of which are believed to have links with suspected  Al-
Qaeda operative Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Iraq's most wanted man.
</P>
<P>
The group claimed responsibility for a December 21 attack on a  US
army base in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul in which 14 US  soldiers
were among 22 people killed, the deadliest single attack on  American
forces in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ansar al-Sunna has also threatened to attack polling stations  and
Iraqis who take part in landmark elections slated for January  30.
