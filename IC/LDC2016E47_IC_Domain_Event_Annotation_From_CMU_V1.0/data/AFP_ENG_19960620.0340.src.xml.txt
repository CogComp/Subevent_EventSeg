HAMAS sends Netanyahu conditions for halting attacks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Islamic movement HAMAS issued a ceasefire offer Thursday to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, offering to suspend attacks if his new
right-wing government agrees to a long list of demands, including the
release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
In what the group described as a "golden opportunity" for Netanyahu,
the Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS) said in a statement faxed to
news organizations that it was willing to order a "global" freeze in
its military activities if its conditions were met.
</P>
<P>
The movement, which was responsible for most suicide bombings in
Israel but has not carried out any known attacks since early March,
centered its demands on a halt to all "offensive" Israeli actions
against Palestinians and on the release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Taking up the terms of similar truce offers issued earlier this year,
the statement insisted on an "end to Zionist terrorism in all its
forms against HAMAS and the Qassam Brigades," the movement's military
wing.
</P>
<P>
It also called for Israel to lift the military closure imposed on the
West Bank and Gaza Strip following a spate of suicide bombings by
HAMAS and the smaller Islamic Jihad group in February and March which
killed 58 people.
</P>
<P>
The statement signed by the Qassam Brigades, and a separate communique
addressed to the self-rule Palestinian Authority led by Yasser Arafat,
demanded that all militants arrested since those attacks be freed.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinian Authority have arrested several hundred
suspected members of HAMAS and the Islamic Jihad since the bombings.
</P>
<P>
HAMAS also demanded the release of Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, the founder
and spiritual leader of the fundamentalist movement who has been
serving a life sentence in Israeli prisons since 1989.
</P>
<P>
"This is a golden opportunity waving on the visible horizon," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Will Israel take this opportunity to plant the seeds of security and
stability and avoid the suffering, fear and terror for its people, the
scenes of bodies and bullets and explosions, or will it be stupid and
plunge the entire region into the flames of old war and destructive
conflict," it asked.
</P>
<P>
"The Qassam brigades maintain the absolute right to make a suitable
response ... to any Israeli violation of the above conditions," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The suicide bombings in February and March were widely seen as having
ensured Netanyahu's election victory last month over incumbent prime
minsiter Shimon Peres.
