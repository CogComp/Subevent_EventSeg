MADRID, May 11 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
One of the alleged mastermind behind the March 11 Madrid bombings was
under investigation last year for his alleged ties with the Casablanca
terror attacks last May, which killed 45 people, including 12 suicide
bombers, local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan Jamal Zougam, 30, whose telephone had been wiretapped by
the Spanish police nine months ago, was arrested two days after the
Madrid bombings, along with two other Moroccans, who belonged to a
radical group called the Soldiers of Ala, a cell operated in Spain
with close links to Osama Bin Laden's al-Qaida.
</P>
<P>
Since 2001, Zougam had been under investigation until arrested as key
suspect of the Madrid attacks, which killed 191 people and wounded
more than 2,000.
</P>
<P>
Zougam was a longtime resident of Spain and was in Morocco shortly
before the bombing in Casablanca.
</P>
<P>
His apartment in Spain was searched in August 2001.  Police found the
phone numbers of several al-Qaida members but Zougam was not arrested.
</P>
<P>
Police said Zougam usually spent nights in different places in Madrid
to avoid investigations.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers of Ala, a group formed by young radicals of the Islamic
Alliance, was founded in 1995 by Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas, alias Abu
Dahdah. Its members distributed magazines and publications by Osama
Bin Laden, in different religious centers in the capital.
