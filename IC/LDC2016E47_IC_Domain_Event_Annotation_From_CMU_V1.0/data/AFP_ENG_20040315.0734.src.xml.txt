A man currently detained by Spain on suspicion of being the ringleader
of an Al-Qaeda cell in the country, Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas, alias
Abu Dahdah, Monday condemned as an "atrocious crime" last week's train
bombings in Madrid, in a letter published by his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Spanish police had dismantled the 18-men cell in late 2001. Abu Dahdah
has been detained in a Spanish prison since November 2001.
</P>
<P>
He said the train bombings Thursday which killed 200 people and left
nearly 1,500 others wounded were "a savage and indiscriminate act
untypical of a good Muslim".
</P>
<P>
He also called on judicial officials to investigate the bombings
carefully.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dahdah and two other suspects who are also detained, Ghasoub al
Abrash Ghalyoun, who extensively filmed the Twin Towers in New York,
and Driss Chebli are accused of direct involvement with the September
11 attacks in New York and Washington.
