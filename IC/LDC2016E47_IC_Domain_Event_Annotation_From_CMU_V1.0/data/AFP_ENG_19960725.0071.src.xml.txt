Palestinian police arrest HAMAS leader
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palestinian police said Thursday they had arrested a top militant from
the Islamic fundamentalist group HAMAS in the Gaza Strip, Awad Silmi.
</P>
<P>
Police also rounded up a number of other HAMAS members and seized arms
and explosives in the night-time raid.
</P>
<P>
Silmi was arrested in March by Palestinian police after a string of
suicide bombings carried out by HAMAS and the smaller Islamic Jihad
that killed 58 people in Israel, but he escaped from prison three
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
Before the launch of Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip in 1994,
Silmi was hunted by Israel's security services.
</P>
<P>
Along with Mohammad Deif, who is still at large, Silmi is considered
the main leader of the military wing of the Islamic Resistance
Movement (HAMAS) that is pursuing armed attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The rightwing Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
has demanded the Palestinian Authority dismantle all fundamentalist
cells before the peace process can continue.
