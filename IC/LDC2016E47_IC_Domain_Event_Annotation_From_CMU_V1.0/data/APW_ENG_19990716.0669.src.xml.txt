<P>
Kurdish rebels claimed to have killed nine Turkish soldiers and two
village guards in attacks in eastern Turkey, a pro-Kurdish news agency
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rebels killed three soldiers and two village guards in an attack
Thursday against a Turkish state television relay station near the
Turkish-Syrian border, the pro-Kurdish German-based news agency DEM
reported, quoting the Kurdistan Workers Party. State television
officials said they had no report of any such clash.
</P>
<P>
Rebels said they killed six Turkish soldiers in a Tuesday attack on a
paramilitary police station in the province of Van, the agency
reported. Security forces in Van had no information of such an attack.
</P>
<P>
The reported sites of both clashes are in remote and inaccessible
areas of Turkey
</P>
<P>
Village guards are Kurdish militiamen armed by the state to fight the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The rebels vowed earlier this week to put an end to a spate of attacks
against civilians to avenge the death sentence by a Turkish court
against their leader, Abdullah Ocalan. Half a dozen people were killed
and more than 50 injured in those attacks.
</P>
<P>
But rebels said they would continue to fight Turkish forces.
</P>
<P>
In northern Iraq, the rebels claimed to have killed 18 fighters of the
rival Iraqi Kurdistan Democratic Party in fighting Tuesday. The KDP is
allied with Turkey against the Kurdistan Workers Party. That report
also could not be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The rebels maintain key bases in northern Iraq near the Turkish
border.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, suspected Kurdish rebels attacked two police stations in
eastern Turkey, injuring one policeman in the province of Agri,
Turkey's Anatolia news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In the town of Ercis, suspected rebels fired rockets at a police
station, Anatolia said. No one was injured in the attack.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish court last month sentenced Ocalan to death for leading the
PKK's 15-year war for autonomy in southeast Turkey. Some 37,000 people
have been killed in the conflict. ht-lm
