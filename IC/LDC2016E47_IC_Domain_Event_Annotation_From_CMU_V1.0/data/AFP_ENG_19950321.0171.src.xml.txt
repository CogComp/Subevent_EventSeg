Suspected Kurdish separatists continue spate of attacks by Jean-Luc

At least five Turkish interests were hit overnight in the latest of a
week-long spate of firebombings and attacks across Germany that police
say bear the signature of Turkey's main Kurdish separatist group.
</P>
<P>
Police said Tuesday about 70 attacks had now been launched in the last
week, hitting Turkish travel agencies, stores, and cultural centers.
</P>
<P>
In the overnight attacks, a Molotov cocktail was thrown at the offices
of the Hurriyet paper, setting off a fire, and at a travel agency in
Berlin. In the west, in Cologne and in Gelsenkirchen, firebombs were
hurled at Turkish banks, while in Erlenbach the target was a Turkish
cultural club.
</P>
<P>
Police did not rule out links to celebrations of the Kurdish New Year
Tuesday night, when celebrations were planned in several German
cities. The New Year, or Newroz, has seen previous outbreaks of
violence in Germany in recent years.
</P>
<P>
As with earlier incidents this week, the latest attacks only caused
material damage and no injuries. Four suspects have been detained
since the weekend.
</P>
<P>
German Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said he had no doubt the
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), the main Kurdish separatist group
fighting central power in Ankara, is behind the wave of violence. The
PKK has been banned in Germany, where it is considered a terrorist
group, since late 1993.
</P>
<P>
"This is the PKK's signature, that is clear," Kanther said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey on Monday launched a massive offensive against PKK rear bases
in northern Iraq in what Ankara said was its biggest military
operation outside its borders. The operation continued Tuesday, with
Turkish army spoksman Colonel Dogu Silahcioglu vowing, on state-owned
television, the army would "remove all threats against the existence
of the Turkish republic."
</P>
<P>
The trouble here also followed a spate of sectarian violence in
Istanbul last week that unofficial sources said has left 29 dead.
</P>
<P>
The incidents started shortly after Germany's decision not to extend a
moratorium on the repatriation of Kurds whose request for asylum had
been turned down.
</P>
<P>
Bonn imposed the moratorium after eight Turkish MPs of Kurdish origin
were sentenced early December in Ankara to lengthy prison terms in a
ruling that raised new concern in the west over the human rights
situation in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have found tracts on some of the sites they said were
linked to the PKK, which has been waging its war against Ankara since
1984 to set up an independent Kurdish state in the southeast of the
country. At least 15,000 people have been killed in the violence.
</P>
<P>
Despite its ban in Germany, police say the PKK and its satellite
organization remain extremely well organized within this country.
</P>
<P>
Some investigators have not ruled out the possibility that other
extremist groups might be taking advantage of the situation to launch
their own attacks. On Tuesday in Erlenbach and in Cologne, flags of
the extreme-left Turkish group Devremci Sol, which has been banned in
Germany since 1983, were found on some of the attack sites.
</P>
<P>
The German Green party, which has repeatedly denounced what it says is
Ankara's repression of the Kuridsh minority, warned against blaming
everything on the PKK.
</P>
<P>
"This could be extremists from the German right or Turkish secret
agents" stirring up trouble, said Green deputy Amke Dieterl-Scheuer on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Police earlier speculated the attacks in Germany could have been
launched by Turkish Alawites, also known as Alevis, a moderate Moslem
community that bore the brunt of the trouble in Istanbul last week.
</P>
<P>
But the German interior ministry ruled this out on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Two million Turks live in Germany, including around 400,000 Kurds and
some 600,000 Alawites.
</P>
<P>
Security analysts are quick to stress that these numbers alone mean
any tension in Turkey is bound to have repercussions back in Germany,
where Turks started pouring in during the 1960s and 1970s to seek jobs
as immigrant workers.
