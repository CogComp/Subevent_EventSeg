Turkey

ISTANBUL, Turkey
</P>
<P>
A Kurdish rebel group said it was responsible for an explosion over
the weekend that killed four people, including three foreign tourists,
but local authorities insisted on Tuesday that the blast was caused by
an exploding gas canister.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons rebel group claimed responsibility for
the explosion in a call to the pro-Kurdish Firat news agency, warning
tourists not to come to Turkey, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
But authorities denied the claims.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't that. It was a gas canister explosion," said Guzide Ormeci,
a spokeswoman for the governor's office of the Mediterranean resort
town of Antalya.
</P>
<P>
Turkish authorities are reluctant to publicize attacks at the height
of the tourism season in Turkey. After a bombing in Istanbul earlier
this month, the police chief asked journalists not to "exaggerate" the
incident "because the tourist season is coming up."
</P>
<P>
Authorities later said that explosion was caused by a bomb in a trash
can, which the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons also claimed.
</P>
<P>
The explosion on Sunday occurred at a restaurant near a waterfall in
Manavgat, a popular tourist district of Antalya. Those killed included
a Norwegian, a Hungarian and a Turkish waiter, authorities have said.
Local official Fikret Dayioglu said Tuesday that the fourth victim,
previously believed to be a Russian, was in fact a 42-year-old Dutch
woman.
</P>
<P>
The Vatan newspaper said security cameras near the waterfall showed
two people standing watch as another put a package into a trash
container some 20 minutes before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper's claims could not be independently verified, and Vatan
did not publish pictures from the security cameras.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons have claimed responsibility for several
fires, sabotage attacks and explosions, but authorities have either
denied or failed to verify those claims.
</P>
<P>
Kurdish rebels have been fighting for autonomy in Turkey since 1984,
and some 37,000 people have been killed. Most of the fighting has
occurred in the Kurdish-majority southeast, where deadly clashes
between rebels and Turkish soldiers are frequent.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons appear to be a new and particularly
violent group, which has vowed repeatedly to bring the fight to
Turkey's cities and tourist areas.
</P>
<P>
Separately, no official reason has yet been given for the massive fire
in May that destroyed much of the cargo section at Istanbul's airport,
which the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons also claimed.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, suspected Kurdish rebels exploded a remote-controlled
bomb on a railway in eastern Turkey, causing damage to the line, the
state-run Anatolia news agency reported. The explosion came just after
a passenger train had passed, the agency said.
