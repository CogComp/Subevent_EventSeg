Fighting intensifies in Somali capital, 30 dead in two days (ADDS
details, quotes, background)
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Somalia's capital
during two days of heavy clashes rooted in a leadership dispute,
witnesses said Wednesday, when at least 17 people died.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, in the Medina area of southwest Mogadishu, is between
militiamen loyal to warlord Musa Sudi Yalahow against those supporting
his former ally Omar Mohamud Mohamed, better known as "Finish".
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were civilians caught in the crossfire or killed
when artillery shells struck residential houses.
</P>
<P>
The dead included four children.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of bloodletting comes ahead of talks aimed at
bringing lasting peace to Somalia, scheduled to take place in
neighbouring Kenya in September, under the auspices of the seven-
nation Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD).
</P>
<P>
It also comes just after the UN Security Council, concerned about the
violence in Somalia, unanimously approved a resolution on Monday to
tighten a 10-year-old but only lightly enforced arms embargo.
</P>
<P>
Un Security Council Resolution 1425, which was presented by Norway,
bans direct, government-to-government deliveries as well as financing
and military advisors, and puts in place a committee charged with
setting guidelines for violations and enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Fighting erupted on Tuesday, but died down late in the afternoon with
only sporadic gunfire heard in the area overnight. Clashes intensified
again on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Yalahow and Finish are two former allies who headed the United Somali
Congress/Somalia Salvation Alliance (USC/SSA) faction, but fell out in
December when Finish signed a peace deal with Somalia's interim
government, which is fiercely opposed by Yalahow.
</P>
<P>
Each of the two warlords has claimed to be the head of the USC/SSA and
the leadership feud is believed to be the cause of the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
"We have destroyed the military ability of Yalahow. His forces took
refuge in the part of Medina controlled by warlord Hussein Mohamed
Aidid," said Abdullahi Sheikh Hassan, one of Finish's allies.
</P>
<P>
Four of Yalahow's armed vehicles have been destroyed since Tuesday,
including two that were taken out of action on Wednesday when six
militiamen travelling in them were killed, Hassan said.
</P>
<P>
Hassan accused Yalahow and Ethiopia of responsibility for the death of
civilians by using "unnecessary firepower" against areas populated by
civilians.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia is accountable for the loss of lives in Medina and promoting
hostilities in Somalia by supplying Yalahow with heavy weapons, such
as the 120mm mortar shells used on Wednesday morning," Hassan charged.
</P>
<P>
The country most frequently mentioned in the UN's July report was
Ethiopia, which it says supplied not only small-calibre arms but
mortars and anti-aircraft artillery to groups opposed to Somalia's
transitional government in June 2001.
</P>
<P>
But Yalahow counter-accused the Somali Transitional National
Government (TNG) of supplying weapons to Finish to undermine security
in his fiefdom.
</P>
<P>
"The security I maintained for 11 years in Medina is going to be
destabilized by TNG mercenaries. Finish is nothing but a messenger of
TNG," Yalahow told AFP by telephone.
</P>
<P>
He accused Eritrea, Egypt, Yemen, Libya and Djibouti of sending
weapons to Somalia to establish a puppet regime in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been without an effective national government since 1991,
when the regime of dictator Mohammed Siad Barre collapsed.
</P>
<P>
The TNG has said it will attend the talks in its capacity as the
governing authority, while the Somali Reconciliation and Restoration
Council (SRRC), grouping armed warlords controlling large parts of
southern Somalia, wants the TNG to be represented just like any other
"faction."
</P>
<P>
Sixteen peace conferences for Somalia have been held in Ethiopia,
Djibouti, Kenya, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Libya during the past
decade, but all failed to resolve the political quagmire.
