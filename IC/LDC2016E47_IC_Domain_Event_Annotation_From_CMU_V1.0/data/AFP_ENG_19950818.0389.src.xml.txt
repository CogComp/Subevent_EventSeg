Suspected HAMAS bomber surrenders after six-hour gunbattle
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A member of the Islamic militant movement HAMAS suspected of planning
a suicide attack against Israel surrendered to Palestinan police here
after a six-hour shootout on Friday, HAMAS said.
</P>
<P>
Wail Nassar, 23, a member of Ezzedin al-Qasim, HAMAS's military wing,
was on the run from both Palestinian and Israeli police for planning
anti-Israeli attacks, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The gunbattle began when Palestinian police surrounded a house in the
Sheikh Radwan neighborhood of Gaza city where Nassar and two
collaborators where hiding.
</P>
<P>
The three HAMAS members, when called on to surrender, opened fire on
police with M-16 assault rifles, Palestinian sources reported.
Hundreds of police reinforcements were called out for the battle.
</P>
<P>
As the shootout dragged on, hundreds of HAMAS backers demonstrated in
support of the militants and threw stones at police, injuring seven of
them slightly. Police fired in the air to disperse the crowds.
</P>
<P>
One policeman was shot and wounded, police sources said without
specifying who fired the shot.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security officials opened negotiations with a HAMAS leader
in Gaza, Imad Faluji, that which ended with the surrender of the three
militants.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security services had been searching for one of the three,
Awad Silmi, HAMAS said in a statement, without identifying the third
militant.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military sources said Nassar was part of a five-member cell
that planned on exploding a bomb-laden Fiat in the streets of Tel
Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Nassar, a student at the Islamic university in Gaza, fled his home
just before a Palestinian police patrol came hunting for him last
week, his family and friends said.
</P>
<P>
Israel closed off the Gaza Strip on August 10 following reports of the
planned bombing in Tel Aviv. An army spokesman said the closure would
remain in effect until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The raid on the house came three days after Palestinian police
arrested another HAMAS member for planning anti-Israeli attacks,
Palestinian officials said without identifying the militant.
</P>
<P>
HAMAS and Islamic Jihad, both opposed to the peace process with
Israel, have claimed most anti-Israeli attacks since self-rule was
launched in the Gaza Strip and Jericho in the West Bank in May 1994.
