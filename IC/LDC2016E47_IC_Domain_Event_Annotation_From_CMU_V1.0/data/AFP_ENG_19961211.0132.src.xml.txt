HAMAS burns Israeli flag in Gaza demonstration
</HEADLINE>

<P>
More than 1,000 members of the Palestinian radical group HAMAS
demonstrated at Gaza's Islamic University on Wednesday and burned an
Israeli flag, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Youths wearing headbands emblazoned "Ezz Eddin al-Qassam Brigades,"
HAMAS' military wing, stomped on the Israeli flag before setting it
alight on stage before the crowd, made up mostly of students.
</P>
<P>
They also carried pictures of Yehiya Ayash, the "engineer" of HAMAS
suicide bombing attacks who was killed in Gaza City last January,
apparently by Israeli agents.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was officially to mark the ninth anniversary of the
start of the Palestinian Intifada uprising, from 1987 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
It comes two days before a planned public rally by the Islamic
Resistance Movement HAMAS, the first one in over a year to be
permitted by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
The rally, to be held Friday in Khan Yunis, south of Gaza City,
sparked criticisms from Israel that Arafat was seeking to send a
warning that the "HAMAS option" still exists if negotiations with
Israel remain deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
HAMAS, along with Islamic Jihad, conducted a string of anti-Israeli
suicide bombings which left 58 people dead in February and March in
revenge for Ayash's assassination.
</P>
<P>
Under Israeli pressure, Arafat launched a crackdown against Islamic
groups, arresting hundreds of their members. But most have been
released in the past few months.
