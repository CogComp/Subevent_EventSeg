IN PERU, THE SHINING PATH'S REIGN OF TERROR IS ENDING
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AYACUCHO, Peru
</P>
<P>
The main plaza of this Andean town is buzzing with activity: vendors
hawking their wares, schoolboys playing soccer, students arguing
politics and lost tourists seeking directions.
</P>
<P>
These lively streets provide the best evidence that the Peruvian
government has all but won the war against the Shining Path guerrilla
movement.
</P>
<P>
It was in 1980, at the University of Ayacucho, that Abimael Guzman
founded the Maoist insurgent group, which has killed more than 30,000
people in its quest to turn Peru into a cooperative farming society.
</P>
<P>
And it was on the streets of Ayacucho that the Shining Path's reign of
terror was most strongly felt. A few years ago, gunfire and explosions
were heard throughout the day and well into the night as the Shining
Path and the army battled each other and imposed competing visions of
justice on the local citizenry.
</P>
<P>
Almost everyone in this war-scarred town of 100,000 people has a
relative or friend who was killed in the warfare. Nearly one-third of
the population fled Ayacucho for safety in Lima, the Peruvian capital
200 miles away, and those who remained dared not venture out after
dark.
</P>
<P>
``When this city was dominated by the Shining Path, there was an ever-
present fear and terror,'' said Jorge Garcia Prado, who was mayor from
1983 to 1989. ``There was no joy, no happiness, no social life. So
many of our family and friends were killed that we had no more
emotions. We were like the walking dead.''
</P>
<P>
Today, following the capture of Guzman and most of Shining Path's top
leaders in 1992, the life in Ayacucho's main plaza -- the Parque Sucre
-- is back, under the watchful eye of the military.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of new bars, hotels, restaurants and other businesses have
opened in the past year, including three new discos, which have
revived Ayacucho's night life.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the Puerto Rican rock group La CoCoban gave a concert
in the plaza; the top-rated soap opera, ``The Upper and Lower
Classes,'' filmed an episode here; and a well-known road race, Caminos
de Inca, has started passing through Ayacucho again.
</P>
<P>
``We can say without reservation that the Shining Path no longer
exists in the place where it was born,'' said Walter Ascarza Olivares,
Ayacucho's mayor. ``Ayacucho is once again the lively, energetic city
that people used to know.''
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1539, Ayacucho is an important business and tourist center
in the central Andes. Before the Shining Path, it was famous for its
churches, colonial mansions and markets. It was the site of the battle
on Dec. 9, 1824, that ended Spanish rule in Peru.
</P>
<P>
With the decline of the Shining Path, thousands of people have come
home. After spending three years studying in Lima, Cesar Prado, 29, a
Hare Krishna, returned this year to set up a street stand where he
sells religious literature and products.
</P>
<P>
``I left because there was nothing here but killing and destruction,''
Prado said. ``I decided to come back because things have changed here
and I have changed. With the end of the violence I think people here
are ready to accept the teachings of Krishna.''
</P>
<P>
Marine Sulca, 20, a grocery clerk, left Ayacucho with her family in
1992, after the Shining Path killed her brother as they stole his car.
Her family returned early this year.
</P>
<P>
``They shot him in the head as he begged for mercy,'' she said. ``The
pain was unbearable for me. But it's different now. It's more
tranquil, more normal -- the way it was when I was a girl. I pray that
the Shining Path won't come back. We can't let them.''
</P>
<P>
President Alberto Fujimori has pledged to eliminate the Shining Path
by the end of his term next July. Fujimori, who is seeking re-
election, seized sweeping dictatorial powers in April 1992 after
charging that a corrupt Congress was hindering the fight against
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The military scored its greatest blow against the Shining Path in
September 1992 when it captured Guzman, who has since called for peace
talks. In the last two years, the military crackdown has led to
widespread arrests and defections from the Shining Path.
</P>
<P>
Oscar Ramirez Duran, known as Feliciano, took over the movement and
has vowed to continue fighting. Last month, guerrillas bombed targets
in Lima, including two branches of the country's largest bank and an
air force officers' club. The buildings were damaged, but there were
no injuries.
</P>
<P>
But Western intelligence sources in Peru said that they believed the
Shining Path had been largely defeated strategically because its
central committee, which coordinated the various factions, had been
captured.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The crackdown is succeeding in part with the cooperation of peasants,
who with military help formed hundreds of village militias to fend off
the rebels in the country's mountainous interior.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Torres, 19, a student at the University of Ayacucho, put on his
best boots to go out dancing the other night.
</P>
<P>
``It's 11:30 p.m., and I'm going out to have fun,'' Torres said. ``A
few years ago this would have been unthinkable in this town. I'm glad
that the Shining Path is gone so that I can go out and dance while I'm
still young enough to enjoy it.''
