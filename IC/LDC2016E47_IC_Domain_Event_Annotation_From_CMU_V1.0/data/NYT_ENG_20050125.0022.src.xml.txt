BAGHDAD, Iraq
</P>
<P>
Security forces in Iraq have captured two senior aides to the most
wanted militant in Iraq, bringing in his top bomb-maker and his
propaganda chief in the past 10 days, an Iraqi government spokesman
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The announcements came hours after a suicide car bomb exploded near
the headquarters of Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's political party,
injuring at least 14 people, nine of them policemen, the Interior
Ministry said. The bomb detonated at a checkpoint guarded by a special
unit of the Iraqi police.
</P>
<P>
The captured bomb-maker, Sami Muhammad Ali Said al-Jaaf, was seized in
Baghdad on Jan. 15. He is believed to have taken part in three-
quarters of the car bombings in the capital since the war began, the
government spokesman, Thaier al-Naqib, said in a written statement.
Major car bombings here began with an attack on the Jordanian Embassy
in August 2003 and have killed hundreds.
</P>
<P>
Al-Naqib said al-Jaaf also used the name Abu Omar al-Kurdi and is
considered to be a lieutenant of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian
militant who has a $25 million bounty on his head.
</P>
<P>
Al-Jaaf has confessed to making the explosives used in the bombing of
the Jordanian Embassy, which killed at least 11 people, al-Naqib said.
He also confessed to taking part in the car bombing later the same
month in Najaf that killed at least 95 people, including Muhammad Bakr
al-Hakim, a cleric who founded the most prominent Shiite political
party.
</P>
<P>
Al-Naqib issued another statement later on Monday saying that on Jan.
14, security forces captured al-Zarqawi's chief of propaganda, Hasam
Hamad Abdullah Muhsin al-Dulaimi, who is also known as Dr. Hassan. Al-
Dulaimi had not served long in the post; he took the job after
American-led forces killed the former propaganda chief, Hassan
Ibrahim, in a Baghdad raid on Dec. 13, al-Naqib said.
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Hassan has told us that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi designated Abu Omar
al-Kurdi as the lieutenant responsible for attacking election sites
located in Baghdad," he said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Naqib's statements could not be independently verified, but it
seems that any such arrests, while providing some good news before the
elections this Sunday, have not lessened the violence aimed at
disrupting the voting.
</P>
<P>
Al-Zarqawi's group posted an Internet message claiming responsibility
for the car bombing on Monday morning near Allawi's political
headquarters, the latest in a string of at least a half-dozen such
attacks in the past week which have killed and wounded scores of
people.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, rumors have spread throughout the capital that al-
Zarqawi might have been captured, or that American forces might have
detained him and let him go without realizing whom they had arrested.
</P>
<P>
Those rumors dovetailed with two incendiary Internet audio recordings
attributed to al-Zarqawi. In the second one, which appeared on Sunday,
al-Zarqawi said his forces "have declared an all-out war on this evil
principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology." He
renewed a call for insurgents to attack the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
The bombing on Monday morning near the headquarters of Allawi's party,
the Iraqi National Accord, rattled windows miles away and sent a plume
of smoke above the Baghdad skyline. Policemen at a checkpoint had
opened fire on a driver speeding up to the post, forcing the car bomb
to detonate early, said Col. Adnan Abdul-Rahman, an Interior Ministry
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place near the Green Zone, a four-square-mile
fortified compound that houses the U.S. Embassy and the headquarters
of the interim Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
In Najaf, the local chief of Iraqi intelligence, Haidar Ghalib al-
Jazaeri, said American soldiers had shot dead an intelligence officer
on Monday on the road between Najaf and Diwaniya. The officer, Imad
Abid Shaban al-Khuzai, was shot while trying to pass an American
convoy, al-Jazaeri said, adding that al-Khuzai's brother was wounded.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Flora Lee, a spokeswoman for the U.S. military, said the
military's media desk had no reports on such a shooting.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, gunmen assassinated an Iraqi judge as he was leaving his
home in eastern Baghdad, the Iraqi police said. The judge, identified
as Qais Hashim Shameri, and his son were killed in a roadside ambush,
the police said.
</P>
<P>
Five American soldiers were killed and two were injured in a vehicle
accident near the town of Khan Bani Saad north of Baghdad on Monday
night, the military said Tuesday without releasing details.
</P>
<P>
The military also said another soldier had died Tuesday morning in a
roadside bomb attack.
