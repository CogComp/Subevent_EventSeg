Heavy fighting reported in breakaway Somaliland
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Heavy fighting has erupted in Somaliland between forces loyal to the
breakaway republic's leader Mohamed Ibrahim Egal and opposition
militia in the region's second largest city of Buro, the opposition
group's spokesman Mohamed Ismail said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tanks, heavy artillery and rocket propelled grenades were used during
the battles, which left 12 people dead and a large number of wounded
on both sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ismail said the fighting, which lasted several days, intensified when
forces loyal to Egal's Habar Awal sub-clan of the Issak attacked a
militia stronghold of his main opposition rival, the Gar Hajis sub-
clan, at El-Hume, 20 kilometres (12 miles) west of Buro.
</P>
<P>
Egal militia, claiming to be the national defence force, said they had
captured two opposition posts, killing and wounding many of the
fighters, destroying three technicals (armed pick-up trucks) and
confiscating artillery guns and assorted ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Ismail dismissed that claim, saying "the terrorist attack" against the
stability of Somalia's northern region was repelled with great loss to
the attackers, who had abandoned their military hardware.
</P>
<P>
Egal, currently in the "capital," Hargeisa, earlier said his
government had launched an eradication campaign against what he called
anti-Somaliland government elements. He accused Somali warlord Mohamed
Farah Aidid and some foreign governments of illegally intervening in
Somaliland's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Warring Issak sub-clans mainly support the independence of Somaliland,
which broke away from Somalia in May 1991, but the non-Issak sub-clans
of the Dlbahanti, Gadabursi, Warsangeli and Issa are in favour of
unity of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
No foreign government has recognised the independence of Somaliland, a
former British colony which joined with a former Italian colony to
form inmdependent Somalia in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been without a government since the overthrow of dictator
Mohamed Siad Barre in January 1991.
