Yemen Conflict Intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ignoring U.N. efforts to halt the war in Yemen, northern Yemeni ground
forces backed by bombers have pushed closer to Aden, capital of the
southern Yemeni secessionist regime, intensifying a conflict that has
raised fears of instability and foreign intervention along the Persian
Gulf oil routes.
</P>
<P>
Arab and U.S. officials voiced concern that the six-week-old civil
war, which has already destroyed Yemen's four-year experiment with
unity, could become an invitation to involvement by radical
governments in Iran, Sudan and Libya on the side of Islamic militants
who wield great influence in Sanaa, the northern capital.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the oil giant just north of Yemen with a history of
involvement in Yemeni affairs and a large Yemeni community, has shown
increasing nervousness over pursuit of the war by the northern
government of President Ali Abdallah Salih despite a June 1 cease-fire
brokered by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Salih, who was president of the unified Yemen government from 1990
until the south broke away May 21, has allied himself with a
conservative Islamic party, Al Islah, that posted a strong showing in
legislative elections last year.
</P>
<P>
The increasingly bloody battle between Salih and southern leader Ali
Salim Beidh, although still confined to a small, remote corner of the
Arabian Peninsula on the Bab al-Mandeb Strait, thus has taken on
regional dimensions and generated the concern voiced with growing
urgency in Arab and Western capitals as northern forces move
relentlessly toward Aden.
</P>
<P>
Southern Yemeni leaders said 54 people were killed Thursday and Friday
in bombing of besieged Aden. Officials quoted in news agency reports
from the southern capital said the casualty toll is likely to rise.
</P>
<P>
The northern Yemeni bombing raids appeared to be targeting Aden's
military airport. The facility, on the coastal fringe of the city, is
southern Yemen's most developed air base and the platform for its most
effective air attacks against advancing northern ground forces.
</P>
<P>
The northern troops have moved to within six miles of Aden, on a
desert plain on the southern side of a forbidding mountain range that
constituted a natural barrier. They also are approaching Mukalla, an
oil port 300 miles east of Aden where Beidh set up his headquarters
soon after the war broke out.
</P>
<P>
In broadcasts on Sanaa radio monitored by news agencies, the north
warned southern civilians Friday to stay away from strategic targets
in Aden, including the south's military headquarters, radio and
television buildings and offices of the south's ruling Socialist
Party. This was taken as an indication more bombings are planned.
</P>
<P>
The southern leadership, whose army has been outmanned and outgunned
since the outbreak of hostilities May 4, has given a proposed a plan
to Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the U.N. envoy and troubleshooter, for 200 U.N.
observers to enforce the cease-fire. But there has been no reaction
from the northern forces.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahimi, an Algerian aide to U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-
Ghali, has been moving between Sanaa and Aden and other Arab capitals
of the Persian Gulf in an effort -- so far fruitless -- to engineer an
effective cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
``The longer this lasts, the more scores to settle and the less likely
it is to settle this peacefully. You don't want to have a war raging
in the Arabian peninsula,'' a Saudi diplomat in Washington cautioned.
</P>
<P>
Robert Pelletreau, assistant secretary of state for the Middle East,
said in congressional testimony Tuesday that there is considerable
investment in Yemen by American companies, particularly involving oil
production and exploration in northern and southern Yemen.
</P>
<P>
``We do not want to see Yemen become a source of instability in the
region. We would not want to see the fighting produce an outflow of
refugees, for example, that could become a destabilizing factor in
that area of the world,'' Pelletreau said.
</P>
<P>
Countries sponsoring Islamic militants in the Middle East,
particularly Iran, have solicited followers by providing social
services and religious comfort in crisis areas neglected by state
institutions. This has been especially effective in areas of Lebanon,
Egypt, Sudan and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Washington strongly backed the Yemeni union when it was formed. But
Pelletreau's testimony indicated that the war and other complexities
in an evolving political configuration of the conservative north and
the formerly Marxist south are delaying development of a clear-cut
U.S. position on whether unity remains viable. Most Arab countries of
the Persian Gulf, led by Saudi Arabia, have expressed support for
Beidh's breakaway government, concluding that Salih's attempt to
reimpose a unified government weighted with northern leaders and
policies cannot succeed.
