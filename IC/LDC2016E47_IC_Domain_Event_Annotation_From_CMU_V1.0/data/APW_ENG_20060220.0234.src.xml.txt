BARISAL, Bangladesh

<P>
Four fugitive leaders of a banned Islamic militant group were
sentenced in absentia to life in prison on Monday in connection with a
bomb attack that killed two judges in southern Bangladesh last year,
an official said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the banned Jumatul Mujahedeen Bangladesh, which aims to
replace the Muslim nation's secular state with strict Islamic law,
were convicted of coordinating the supply of explosives in the Nov. 14
attack, said prosecution lawyer Mujibur Rahman.
</P>
<P>
Special court judge Abdul Matin handed down the sentence to Shaikh
Abdur Rahman, Siddiqul Islam, Mollah Omar and Khaled Saifullah in a
crowded courtroom in Barisal city, 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of
national capital Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Under Bangladeshi law, a life term usually means 25 years or more in
jail.
</P>
<P>
Matin earlier this month jailed three other militants from the group
for 40 years for the attack. One, Hasan Al Mamun, allegedly hurled the
bomb that killed the two judges in Jhalakathi town, next to Barisal
city.
</P>
<P>
Bystanders later caught Mamun, who suffered severe head injuries in
the attack, and discovered explosives strapped to his body.
</P>
<P>
Jumatul Mujahedeen Bangladesh is blamed for nationwide bombings that
have killed 26 people and wounded dozens of others since August 2005.
