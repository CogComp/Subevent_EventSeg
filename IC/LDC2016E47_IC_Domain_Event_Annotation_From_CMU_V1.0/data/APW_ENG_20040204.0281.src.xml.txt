<P>
An Iraqi insurgent group claimed responsibility Wednesday for the twin
suicide attacks last weekend on the offices of two Kurdish political
parties in Irbil, citing the Kurds' ties to the United States.
</P>
<P>
``Two of our martyrdom-seeking brothers ... broke into two dens of the
devils in the city of Irbil in the north of Iraq,'' said the statement
by ``Jaish Ansar al-Sunna,'' or Army of the Protectors of the Sunna.
</P>
<P>
Sunna refers to the collective teachings of the Prophet Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
The statement was posted in Arabic on a Web site that frequently
carries statements by Islamic militants. It said the Sunday attacks
were launched because the two Kurdish parties ``paved the way for the
American crusader army.''
</P>
<P>
The claim could not be independently confirmed. The name of the
organization was included among a dozen insurgent groups that issued a
joint statement this week in Ramadi and Fallujah warning Iraqis
against cooperating with the U.S.-led occupation.
</P>
<P>
Kurdish and U.S. officials had suspected the attacks were carried out
by Ansar al-Islam, an extremist group with alleged ties to al-Qaida.
The attacks killed numerous officials of the Kurdistan Democratic
Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the Army of the Protectors of the Sunna condemned
the PUK for the crackdown on Ansar al-Islam. It said PUK leader Jalal
Talabani ``was coordinating with the crusaders (Americans) to attack
our mujahedeen brothers from Ansar al-Islam group and their women and
children.''
</P>
<P>
The statement said U.S. and Kurdish forces ``pummeled them with tens
of U.S. rockets, shelled them with aircraft and for eight days,
nonstop, whole villages with their mosques were obliterated from the
face of the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
The statement was signed by Abu Abdullah al-Hassan bin Mahmoud,
identified as the leader of Jaish Ansar al-Sunna.
