HEBRON, West Bank (AP)
</P>
<P>
A Jewish settler armed with a submachine gun on Tuesday shot and
killed a Palestinian and wounded three others in the heart of this
divided West Bank town, Palestinian officials said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians rioted after the shooting, throwing stones and a firebomb
at Israeli border police, Israeli reports said. Israeli troops fired
warning shots in the air.
</P>
<P>
The shooting comes at a time of impasse in negotiations between
Israelis and Palestinians. It also follows a summit in Washington in
which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refused to agree to
Palestinian demands for a freeze on building a controversial Jewish
housing project in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Noam Federman, leader of the community of 500 Jews living in the city,
said the shooting came after two Israeli students from a religious
school were attacked with tear gas or stones.
</P>
<P>
One of the Israelis fired in response, he said, adding the two
Israelis had to be treated for injuries after the encounter.
</P>
<P>
According to a witness, Hussein Natche, a Jewish settler opened fire
with an Uzi submachine gun in a narrow street between the central
market and Ibrahimi Mosque, which is also known as the Tomb of the
Patriarchs.
</P>
<P>
Natche said the man who was killed was shot three times in the chest.
He said there was no apparent reason for the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police identified the victim as Assam Rashid Arafeh, 30,
and Aliya hospital officials said he died of his wounds.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuchin said a Jewish settler was
arrested for shooting a Palestinian after he was pelted with stones.
She said she did not know the condition of the Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
In the unrest that followed the shooting, APTV cameraman Imad Isseid
was injured in the leg after being struck with a metal bar.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army imposed a curfew on the city center where the
shooting took place. Israel still controls 20 percent of the city
after turning over the rest to Palestinian rule in January.
