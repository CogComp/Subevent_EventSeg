Turkish Kurdish separatist guerrillas killed eight Iraqi Kurds,
including four children and a woman, in an ambush on a convoy of
vehicles in northern Iraq, informed sources said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
One of the victims was Faddah Irfan Harcouri a former leader of the
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) which Turkey on Thursday said it
would entrust with border security after it withdraws its troops from
the country.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas belonging to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) attacked
the convoy, travelling from Zakho to Telkeber village, with automatic
weapons and rockets, the sources said, citing Zako's police chief,
Naguib Shalon.
</P>
<P>
The attack on Thursday was led by Said Abdullah, leader of the PKK in
Telkeber, who is working with the KDP's main rivals, the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK), the sources said.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate comment from inside Iraqi Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
The KDP, led by Massud Barzani, controls the border area between
Turkey and Iraq and has been in armed conflict with the PUK since last
year.
</P>
<P>
The killings were the third serious incident in northern Iraq since
Turkey launched a huge military operation against the PKK in the
border region on March 20.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday three Turkish Red Crescent workers and five Kurds were
killed in a clash near the city of Dahuk during a funeral procession.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds were in mourning for seven Iraqi Kurdish shepherds killed
and mutilated by Turkish troops, a charge denied by Ankara which
blamed the PKK separatists.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish army has said at least 334 PKK militants have been killed
in its operation, which has been roundly condemned by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament criticized the intervention Thursday and
stressed that it would withhold its approval of a proposed customs
union between the EU and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But Prime Minister Tansu Ciller rejected the criticism. "The decision
of the European Parliament does not affect us at all," she said.
