report

<P>
Spanish security services believe that the people who carried out last
week's deadly bombings on trains in Madrid may have had links to the
Islamic extremist group Al-Qaeda and also be part of the group which
carried out devastating attacks in the Moroccan city of Casablanca
almost a year ago, the El Pais newspaper said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting sources close to the investigation into the Madrid bombings,
which left 200 people dead and over 1,400 injured last Thursday, the
paper said the security services had found links between one of three
Moroccans detained since the Madrid bombings, and the group held
responsible for the Casablanca attacks.
</P>
<P>
El Pais said investigators had found links between Jamal Zougam, a
Moroccan who was arrested after the Madrid bombings, and people who
are being held in both Morocco and Spain over the Casablanca attacks,
which killed 45 people on May 16 last year. One of the targets was a
Spanish cultural centre, where four Spaniards were among the dead.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Jamal Zougam also had links to a Spanish cell of Al-
Qaeda which was headed by one Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas, also known as
"Abu Dahdah".
</P>
<P>
He has been indicted by the Spanish anti-terrorist prosecutor Baltasar
Garzon on charges relating to the preparation of the attacks of
September 11, 2001 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
El Pais said Zougam was cited at two points in Garzon's indictment,
but was not charged.
</P>
<P>
The paper said he was believed to be an Islamic radical who had
formerly fought in Afghanistan, and who took part in the Casablanca
bombings.
</P>
<P>
El Pais also quoted its security service sources as saying that
Spanish police were looking for four more people believed to be
involved in last week's attacks.
