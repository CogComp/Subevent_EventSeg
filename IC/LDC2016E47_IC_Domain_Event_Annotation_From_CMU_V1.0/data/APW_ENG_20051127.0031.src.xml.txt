BAGHDAD, Iraq
</P>
<P>
Car bombs killed 10 people in Baghdad and elsewhere in central Iraq,
while gunmen opened fire on campaign workers putting up posters in the
run-up to next month's parliamentary elections. More than 270 people
have been killed in the last nine days in car bombings and suicide
attacks in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, the U.S. military said it has received information that
a top aide to the leader of al-Qaida in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi,
was killed last month in Ramadi. The death of Bilal Mahmud Awad Shebah
was confirmed by a close relative and "coalition sources," the
military said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The violence came two days before Saddam Hussein's trial resumes after
a five-week break.
</P>
<P>
The first prosecution witnesses are expected to testify before the
five-judge panel, offering accounts of the deaths of more than 140
Shiite villagers following an assassination attempt against Saddam in
the town of Dujail in 1982.
</P>
<P>
If convicted Saddam and his seven co-defendants could be sentenced to
death by hanging.
</P>
<P>
Six people were killed and 12 wounded when a suicide car bomber struck
in Samarra, 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of Baghdad, police Lt. Col.
Mahmoud Mohammed said.
</P>
<P>
Four other people died when a car bomb exploded in western Baghdad as
two armored cars passed by, according to police Lt. Thaer Mahmoud
said. Nobody in the convoy was injured, but one of the armored cars
was damaged and removed by U.S. forces, Mahmoud said.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the U.S. military said an American soldier assigned to the
2nd Marine Division was killed Friday when a roadside bomb exploded
near his vehicle in Hit, 85 miles (137 kilometers) west of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The latest death raised the number of U.S. service members to die
since the Iraq war started in March 2003 to at least 2,105, according
to an Associated Press count.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Iraqi officials have warned of an upsurge in insurgent
attacks ahead of the Dec. 15 elections, in which voters will choose
the first fully constitutional parliament since Saddam Hussein's rule
collapsed in April 2003.
</P>
<P>
American authorities are hoping for a big Sunni Arab turnout, a move
that could produce a government that would win the trust of the
religious community that forms the backbone of the insurgency.
</P>
<P>
Many Sunnis boycotted the January election, enabling rival Shiites and
Kurds to win an overwhelming share of power and worsening communal
tensions. A government trusted by Sunni Arabs could help defuse the
insurgency and enable U.S. and other international troops to begin
heading home next year.
</P>
<P>
However, insurgents opposed to the election are expected to step up
their campaign of intimidation as the ballot approaches.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, gunmen opened fire on four people as they plastered
campaign posters for the biggest Shiite party on walls in western
Baghdad, killing one person and wounding three, police said.
</P>
<P>
In Mosul, gunmen fired on members of the Iraqi Islamic Party, the
country's largest Sunni Arab political movement, while they were
putting up campaign posters, wounding one person, police said.
</P>
<P>
A statement posted on an Islamist Web in the name of al-Qaida in Iraq
also claimed responsibility for killing a Kurdish election volunteer
in Mosul. The statement said Miqdad Ahmed Sito, 28, was seized in the
city's Shifaa neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
A friend of Sito, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear for
his own safety, said Sito worked for the Organization for Development
and Democratic Dialogue, a non-governmental organization that lectures
voters about elections and the country's new constitution.
</P>
<P>
His bullet-riddled body was found late Tuesday in the same
neighborhood where he was abducted, the friend said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Qaida has often spoken out against elections, saying that devout
Muslims should follow the Muslim holy book Quran as their only formula
for governance. Al-Zarqawi repeatedly has threatened Iraqis who
participate in elections, regardless of whether they are Muslims.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the U.S. military said the al-Zarqawi aide, also
known as Abu Ubaydah, was killed Oct. 14 in Ramadi, a center of the
Sunni Arab-led insurgency 70 miles (113 kilometers) west of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"Detained members of al-Qaida claim Abu Ubaydah served as an
`executive secretary' for Zarqawi; met with Zarqawi frequently; served
as a messenger and gatekeeper for Zarqawi; screened all messages and
requests for meetings with Zarqawi (and) was one of Zarqawi's most
trusted associates," the statement said.
