JERUSALEM (AP)
</P>
<P>
Sheik Mohammed Taha, who was arrested by Israeli troops Monday, is one
of five founders of Hamas and the most senior member of the Islamic
militant group to be detained since fighting erupted 29 months ago.
</P>
<P>
The arrest signaled a turning point in how Israel is dealing with
Hamas, which has killed hundreds of Israelis in shootings and bombings
since its founding in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Taha, 65, a hardline ideologue and close associate of the Hamas
spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, is the first senior Hamas
political leader to be arrested since September 2000, even though the
group has been responsible for most of the attacks on Israelis since
then.
</P>
<P>
In retaliating for Hamas bombings and shootings, Israel has killed
dozens of Hamas activists and rounded up hundreds. It has also hit
installations of the Palestinian security forces, arguing that Yasser
Arafat's Palestinian Authority is responsible for all attacks because
it has failed to rein in militants.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians say the Israeli raids have been counterproductive,
weakening the security forces expected to crack down on Hamas,
Arafat's main political rival.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz suggested Sunday that there would
be a change in direction. ``In the Gaza Strip, we are increasing the
pressure and the scope of our operations against Hamas ... and we will
also operate that way in the West Bank,'' Mofaz said. ``We want to
arrive at a situation where the terror organizations invest more and
more (effort) defending themselves.''
</P>
<P>
Taha and his five sons  _  all senior Hamas activists  _  were caught
off guard by the Israeli arrest raid on Gaza's Bureij refugee camp
early Monday. Taha and his son, Ayman, were wounded in fighting that
erupted when soldiers surrounded the family's home which was later
demolished. The two were taken to an Israeli hospital.
</P>
<P>
Hamas was founded several days after the Dec. 9, 1987 outbreak of the
first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation. At the time,
Yassin, Taha and three other leading Islamic clerics met at Yassin's
home in Gaza City. All five were members of the Muslim Brotherhood, a
movement established a century ago in Egypt with the aim of
establishing Islamic rule in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The five formed Hamas as a strike force of the Muslim Brotherhood. In
the meeting, Yassin, a quadriplegic, was elected leader of Hamas,
while Taha and the other three formed an advisory council and since
then have largely stayed out of the spotlight. Taha has persistently
declined to give interviews.
</P>
<P>
Taha and his family fled to Gaza in the 1948 Mideast war and settled
in the Bureij camp. Taha, a stout man with a short beard, served as a
mosque preacher at Gaza City's Islamic University and at his local
mosque in Bureij.
</P>
<P>
As a Hamas ideologue, Taha's influence stretched across Gaza and into
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military says Taha is responsible for orchestrating and
planning dozens of attacks in which several Israelis were killed.
</P>
<P>
Taha's son, Ayman, 32, is an assistant to Hamas bombmaker Mohammed
Deif, No.1 on Israel's most wanted list, the army said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed and Ayman Taha were both deported by Israel in 1992, along
with more than 400 other suspected Islamic militants. They were sent
to Lebanon for a year and allowed to return in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Ayman and his brother, Yasser, are well-known Hamas military leaders
in Gaza. Both have also been active in the Islamic University's
student council. Ayman has been arrested several times by the
Palestinian Authority for his Hamas activities.
</P>
<P>
Taha's other sons have planted bombs and carried out other attacks,
the army said.
</P>
<P>
Hamas spokesman Abdel Aziz Rantisi said Taha's arrest was a big loss
to the group. ``But this does not mean that Hamas is going to stop its
resistance,'' he said. ``Israel will pay a high price for all of its
crimes.''
</P>
<P>
Israel has targeted known Hamas military wing leaders in the past,
hunting them down and killing them in military operations ranging from
missile strikes to booby-trapping cars and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Salah Shehadeh, the leader of the Hamas military wing in Gaza, was
killed July 23 when Israel dropped a bomb from a fighter plane on his
home. Shehadeh's bodyguard and 13 bystanders also died in the bombing.
