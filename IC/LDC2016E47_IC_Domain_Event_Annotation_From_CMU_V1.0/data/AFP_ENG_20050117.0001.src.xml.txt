A Pakistani Islamic militant has been arrested for his alleged role in
high-profile terror attacks including a plot to kill President Pervez
Musharraf, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>Mohammad Jamil Memon, a member of the extremist organisation Harkatul
Mujahideen Al-Alaami, was detained in the northwestern hill resort of
Swat a few days ago, senior police investigator Manzoor Mughal said.
</P>
<P>Memon admitted his involvement in activies including the April 26,
2002 attempt to kill Musharraf in Karachi, when a remote-controlled
device failed to detonate an explosives-laden van near the president's
motorcade, police said.
</P>
<P>"Memon was initially arrested in Swat and will now be interrogated by
Karachi police for his alleged role in high-profile cases here
including the plot to kill the president," Mughal told AFP.
</P>
<P>Police said they would also quiz Memon over a June 14, 2002 suicide
bomb attack on the US consulate in Karachi, which killed 12
Pakistanis.  The vehicle used in the bid on Musharraf's life was also
employed to strike the consulate.
</P>
<P>Three members of the same Islamic group as Memon were sentenced to 10
years' hard labour for the assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>Two of them -- Mohammad Imran Bhai and Hanif Ayub -- were given death
sentences for bombing the American consulate.
</P>
<P>Al-Alaami is an offshoot of Harkatul Mujahideen, which is battling
Indian rule in the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>Musharraf survived two Al-Qaeda-linked assassination attempts in the
northern city of Rawalpindi in December 2003.
</P>
<P>A junior Pakistan Air Force officer convicted of a key role in one of
the Rawalpindi attacks is still on the run after escaping from jail in
late November, officials have said.
